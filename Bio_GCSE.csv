Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Microscopes,"Living things are all made up of cells, but most cells are so small you can only see them using a microscope. It is important to grasp the units used for such tiny specimens before you start to look at them. The first light microscopes were developed in the mid-t7th century.Their development has continued ever since and they are still widely used to look at cells. Light microscopes use a beam of light to form an image of an object and the best can magnify around 2000 times (x2000), although school microscopes usually only magnify several hundred times.They
are relatively cheap, can be used almost anywhere, and can magnify live specimens (Figures 1 and 2). The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s allowed biologists to see and understand more about the subcellular structures inside cells. These instruments use a beam of electrons to form an image and can magnify objects up to around 2000000times.Transmission electron microscopes give 2D images with very high magnification and resolution. Scanning electron microscopes give dramatic 3D images but lower magnifications (Figure 3). Electron microscopes are large, very expensive, and have to be kept in special temperature, pressure, and humidity- controlled rooms.Microscopes are useful because they magnify things, making them  magnification x4500
look bigger. The height of an average person magnìfied by one of the
best light microscopes would look about 3.5 km, and by an electron
 
microscope about 3500 km. There is, however, a minimum distance between two objects when you can see them clearly as two separate things. If they are closer together than this, they appear as one object. Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two separate points and it is the resolving power of a microscooe that affects how
much detail it can show. A light microscope has a resolving power of about 200 nm, a scanning electron microscope of about 10 nm and a transmission electron microscope of about 0.2 nm — that is approximately the distance apart of two atoms in a solid substance!","Name one advantage and one disadvantage of a light microscope ?

,,Animal and plant cells,"The cells that make up your body are typical animal cells. All cells have some features in common. You can see these features clearly in animal cells. The structure and functions of the parts that make up a cell have been made clear by the electron microscope (Figure 1).You will learn more about how their structure relates to their functions as you study more about specific organ systems during your GCSE Biology course, An average animal cell is around 10-30 pm long (so it would take i00000— 300000 cells to line up along the length of meter ruler). Human beings are animals so human cells are just like most other animal cells, and you will see exactly the same structures inside them. The nucleus — controls all the activities of the cell and is surrounded by the nuclear membrane. It contains the genes of the chromosomes that carry the instructions for making the proteins needed to build new cells or new organisms. The average diameter is around 10 pm. The cytoplasm — a liquid gel in which the organelles are suspended and where most of the chemical reactions needed for life take place. The cell membrane — controls the passage of substances such as glucose and mineral ions into the cell. It also controls the movement of substances such as urea or hormones out of the cell. The mitochondria — structures in the cytoplasm where aerobic respiration takes place, releasing energy for the cell. They are very small: 1—2 pm in length and only 0.2—0.7 pm in diameter. The ribosomes — where protein synthesis takes place, making all the proteins needed in the cell. Plants are very different organisms from animals. They make their own food by photosynthesis. They do not move their whole bodies about from one place to another. Plant cells are often rather bigger than animal cells — they range from 10 to 100 pm in length. Plant cells have all the features of a typical animal cell, but they also contain features that are needed ”for their very different functions (Figures 2 and 3). Algae are simple aquatic organisms, They also make their own food by photosynthesis and have many similar features to plant cells. For centuries they were classified as plants. but now they are classified as part of a different kingdom — the Protista. All plant and algal cells have a cell wall made of cellulose that strengthens the cell and gives it support. Many (but not all) plant cells also have these other features: Chloroplasts are found in all the green parts of a plant.They are green because they contain the green substance chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light so the plant can make food by photosynthesis. Each chloroplast is around C5 pm long. Root cells do not have chloroplasts because they are underground and do not photosynthesise. A permanent vacuole is a space in the cytoplasm filled with cell sap. This is important for keeping the cells rigid to support the plant.","Name the main structures you would expect to find in a human cell ?

,,Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells,"Animal and plant cells are example’s of eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells all have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material that is enclosed in a nucleus. The genetic material is a chemical called DNA and this forms structures called chromosomes that are contained within the nucleus. All animals (including human beings), plants, fungi, and protista and eukaryotes. Bacteria are single-celled living organisms. They are example’s of prokaryotes. At 0.2—2.0 km in length prokaryotes are 1—2 orders of magnitude smaller than eukaryotes. You could fit hundreds of thousands of bacteria on to the full stop at the end of this sentence, so you cannot see individual bacteria without a powerful microscope. When you culture bacteria on an agar Diane, you grow many millions of bacteria. This enables you to see the bacterial colony with your naked eye.
Bacteria have cytoplasm and a cell membrane surrounded Dy a cell wall, but the cell wall does not contain the cellulose you see in plant cells. In prokaryotic cells the genetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus. The bacterial chromosome is a simple DNA loop found free in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells may also contain extra small rings of DNA called plasmids, Plasmids code for very specific features such as antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria have a protective Slime capsules around the outside often cell wall, Some types of bacterium have at least one flagellum (plural: flagella), that is, a long protein strand that Iashes about. These bacteria use their flagella to move themselves around
Many bacteria have little or no effect on other organisms and  many are very useful, some bacteria are harmful. Bacteria can cause diseases in humans and other animals and also in plants. They can also decompose and destroy stored food.","Describe what flagella are ?

,,Specialisation in animal cells,"Although the smallest living organisms are only single cells, they can carry out all of the functions of life. Most organisms are bigger and are made up of lots of cells. Some of these cells become specialized to carry out particular jobs. As an  organism develops, cells differentiate to form different types of specialized cells. Most types of animal cents differentiate at an early stage of development, whereas many types of plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life. As a cell differentiates, it gets different sub-cellular structures that enable it to carry out a particular function. It has become a specialized cell. Some specialized cells, such as egg and sperm cells, work individually. Others are adapted to work as part of a tissue, an organ, or a whole organism. Nerve cells are specialized to carry electrical impulses around the body of an animal (Figure 1).They provide a rapid communication system between
the different parts of the body. They have several adaptations including:         Lots of dendrites to make connections to other nerve cells. An axon that carries the nerve impulse from one place to another. They can be very long - the axon of a nerve cell in a blue whale can be up to 25 m Iong! The longest axon in your body runs from the base of your spine to your big toe. The nerve endings or synapses are adapted to pass the impulses to another cell or between a nerve cell and a muscle in the body using special transmitter chemicals. They contain lots of mitochondria to provide the energy needed to make the transmitter chemicals. Muscle cells are specialized cells that can contract and relax. Striated (striped) muscle cells work together in tissues called muscles {Figure 2). Muscles contract and relax in pairs to move the bones of the skeleton, so vertebrates can move on land and in water, and in some cases fly.
Smooth muscle cells form one of the layers of tissue in your digestive system and they contract to squeeze the food through your gut. Striated muscle celIs have three main adaptations:  They contain special proteins that slide over each other making the fibers contract. They contain many mitochondria to transfer the energy needed for the chemical( reactions that take place as the cells contract and relax. They can store glycogen, a chemical that can be broken down and used in cellular respiration by the mitochondria to transfer the energy needed for the fibers to contract.  Sperm cells are usually released a long way from the egg they are going to fertilise.They contain the genetic information from the male parent. Depending on the type of animal, sperm cells need to move through water or the female reproductive system to reach an egg. Then they have to break into the egg.  Sperm cells have several adaptations to make all this possible (Figure 3):  A long tail whips from side to side to help move the sperm through
water or the female reproductive system. The middle section is full of mitochondria, which transfer the energy
needed for the tail to work.  The acrosome stores digestive enzymes for breaking down the outer layers of the egg. o        A large nucleus contains the genetic information to be passed on.","Name one adaption for the specialised nerver cell and describe how this adaption helps the cell carry out its function ?

,,Specialisation in plant cells,"Animals are not the only organisms to have cells specialized for a particular function within a tissue or an organ. Plants also have very specialized cells with clear adaptations for the job they carry out.
Here are four examples. You find root hair cells close to the tips of growing roots. Plants need to take in lots of water (and dissolved mineral ions). the root hair cells help them to take up water and mineral ions more efficiently. Root hair cells are always relatively close to the xylem tissue. The xylem tissue carries water and mineral ions up into the rest of the plant. Mineral ions are moved into the root hair cell by active transport (Topic B1.9).
Root hair cells (Figure 1) have three main adaptations: They greatly increase the surface area available for water to move into the well. They have a large permanent vacuole that speeds up the movement of water by osmosis from the soil across the root hair cell.  They have many mitochondria that transfer the energy needed for the active transport of mineral ions into the root hair cells.  One of the ways plants offer from animals is that plants can make their own food by photosynthesis. There are lots of plant cells that can carry out photosynthesis — and lots that cannot. Photosynthetic cells (Figure 2) usually Haye a number of adaptations including:  They contain specialized green structures called chloroplasts containing chlorophyll that trap the light needed for photosynthesis. They are usually positioned in continuous layers in the leaves and outer layers of the stem of a plant so they absorb as much light as possible.  They have a large permanent vacuole that helps keep the cell rigid as a result of osmosis (Topic BI.8). When lots of these rigid cells are arranged together to form photosynthetic tissue, they help support the stem.They also keep the leaf spread out so it can capture as much light as possible. Xylem is the transport tissue in plants that carries water and mineral ions from the roots to the highest leaves and shoots. The xylem is also important to supporting the plant.The xylem is made up of xylem cells (Figure 3) that are adapted to their functions in two main ways: o        The xylem cells are alive when they are first formed but a special chemical called lignin builds up in spirals in the cell walls. The cells die and form long hollow tubes that allow water and mineral ions to move easily through them, from one end of the plant to the other. The spirals and rings of lignin in the xylem cells make them very strong and help them withstand the pressure of water moving up the plant. They also help support the plant stem. Ph!oem is the specialized transport tissue that carries the food made by photosynthesis around the body of the plant. It is made up of phloem cells that form tubes rather like xylem cells, but phloem cells do not become lignified and die. The dissolved food can move up and down the phloem tubes to where it is needed. The adaptations of the phloem cells (Figure 4) include:  The cell walls between the cells break down to form special sieve plates These allow water carrying dissolved food to move freely up and down the tubes to where it is needed. Phloem cells lose a lot of their internal structures but they are supported by companion cells that help to keep them alive.The mitochondria of the companion cells transfer the energy needed to move dissolved food up and down the plant in phloem.

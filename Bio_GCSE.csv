Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Microscopes,"Living things are all made up of cells, but most cells are so small you can only see them using a microscope. It is important to grasp the units used for such tiny specimens before you start to look at them. The first light microscopes were developed in the mid-t7th century.Their development has continued ever since and they are still widely used to look at cells. Light microscopes use a beam of light to form an image of an object and the best can magnify around 2000 times (x2000), although school microscopes usually only magnify several hundred times.They
are relatively cheap, can be used almost anywhere, and can magnify live specimens (Figures 1 and 2). The invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s allowed biologists to see and understand more about the subcellular structures inside cells. These instruments use a beam of electrons to form an image and can magnify objects up to around 2000000times.Transmission electron microscopes give 2D images with very high magnification and resolution. Scanning electron microscopes give dramatic 3D images but lower magnifications (Figure 3). Electron microscopes are large, very expensive, and have to be kept in special temperature, pressure, and humidity- controlled rooms.Microscopes are useful because they magnify things, making them	mqgnifîcoŁion x4500
look bigger. The height of an average person magnìfied by one of the
best light microscopes would look about 3.5 km, and by an electron
 
microscope about 3500 km. There is, however, a minimum distance between two objects when you can see them clearly as two separate things. If they are closer together than this, they appear as one object. Resolution is the ability to distinguish between two separate points and it is the resolving power of a microscooe that affects how
much detail it can show. A light microscope has a resolving power of about 200 nm, a scanning electron microscope of about 10 nm and a transmission electron microscope of about 0.2 nm — that is approximately the distance apart of two atoms in a solid substance!","Name one advantage and one disadvantage of a light microscope ?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Animal and plant cells,"The cells that make up your body are typical animal cells. All cells have some features in common. You can see these features clearly in animal cells. The structure and functions of the parts that make up a cell have been made clear by the electron microscope (Figure 1).You will learn more about how their structure relates to their functions as you study more about specific organ systems during your GCSE Biology course, An average animal cell is around 10-30 pm long (so it would take i00000— 300000 cells to line up along the length of meter ruler). Human beings are animals so human cells are just like most other anima! cells, and you will see exactly the same structures inside them. The nucleus — controls all the activities of the cell and is surrounded by the nuclear membrane. It contains the genes on the chromosomes that carry the instructions for making the proteins needed to build new cells or new organisms. The average diameter is around 10 pm. The cytoplasm — a liquid gel in which the organelles are suspended and where most of the chemical reactions needed for life take place. The cell membrane — controls ten passage of substances such as glucose and mineral ions into the cell. It also controls the movement of substances such as urea or hormones out of the cell. The mitochondria — structures in the cytoplasm where aerobic respiration takes place, releasing energy for the cell. They are very small: 1—2 pm in length and only 0.2—0.7 pm in diameter. The ribosomes — where protein synthesis takes place, making all the proteins needed in the cell. Plants sre very different organisms from animals.They make their own food by photosynthesis.They do not move their whole bodies about from one place to another. Plant cells are often rather bigger than animal cells — they range from 10 to 100 pm in length. Plant cells have all the features of a typical animal cell, but they also contain features that are needed ”for their very different functions (Figures 2 and 3). Algae are simple aquatic organisms, They also make their own food by photosynthesis and have many similar features to plant cells. For centuries they were classified as plants. but now they are classified as part of a different kingdom — the protista. All plant and algal cells have a cell wall made of cellulose that strengthens thecell and gives it support. Many (but not all) plant cells also have these other features:  Chloroplasts are found in alt the green parts ofa plant.They are green because they contain the green substance chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs light so the plant can make food by photosynthesis. Each chloroplast is around C5 pm long. Root cells do not have chloroplasts because they are underground and do not photosynthesise. A  permanent vacuole is a space in the cytoplasm filled with cell sap. This is impornant for keeping the cells rigid to supnort the plant.","Name the main structures you would expect to find in a human cell ?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells,"Animal and plant cells are example’s of eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells all have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material that is enclosed in a nucleus. The genetic material is a chemical called DNA and this forms structures called chromosomes that are contained within the nucleus. All animals (including human beings), plants, fungi, and protista and eukaryotes. Bacteria are single-celled living organisms. They are example’s of prokaryotes. At 0.2—2.0 km in length prokaryotes are 1—2 orders of magnitude smaller than eukaryotes. You could fit hundreds of thousands of bacteria on to the full stop at the end of this sentence, so you cannot see individual bacteria without a powerful microscope. When you culture bacteria on an agar Diane, you grow many millions of bacteria. This enables you to see the bacterial colony with your naked eye.
Bacteria have cytoplasm and a cell membrane surrounded Dy a cell wall, but the cell wall does not contain the cellulose you see in plant cells. In prokaryotic cells the genetic material is not enclosed in a nucleus. The bacterial chromosome is a simple DNA loop found free in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotic cells may also contain extra small rings of DNA called plasmids, Plasmids code for very specific features such as antibiotic resistance. Some bacteria have a protective Slime capsules around the outside often cell wall, Some types of bacterium have at least one flagellum (plural: flagella), that is, a long protein strand that Iashes about. These bacteria use their flagella to move themselves around
Many bacteria have little or no effect on other organisms and  many are very useful, some bacteria are harmful. Bacteria can cause diseases in humans and other animals and also in plants. They can also decompose and destroy stored food.","Describe what flagella are ?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Specialisation in animal cells,"Although the smallest living organisms are only single cells, they can carry out all of the functions of life. Most organisms are bigger and are made up of lots of cells. Some of these cells become specialized to carry out particular jobs. As an  organism develops, cells differentiate to form different types of specialized cells. Most types of animal cents differentiate at an early stage of development, whereas many types of plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout life. As a cell differentiates, it gets different sub-cellular structures that enable it to carry out a particular function. It has become a specialized cell. Some specialized cells, such as egg and sperm cells, work individually. Others are adapted to work as part of a tissue, an organ, or a whole organism. Nerve cells are specialized to carry electrical impulses around the body of an animal (Figure 1).They provide a rapid communication system between
the different parts of the body. They have several adaptations including: 	Lots of dendrites to make connections to other nerve cells. An axon that carries the nerve impulse from one place to another. They can be very long - the axon of a nerve cell in a blue whale can be up to 25 m Iong! The longest axon in your body runs from the base of your spine to your big toe. The nerve endings or synapses are adapted to pass the impulses to another cell or between a nerve cell and a muscle in the body using special transmitter chemicals. They contain lots of mitochondria to provide the energy needed to make the transmitter chemicals. Muscle cells are specialized cells that can contract and relax. Striated (striped) muscle cells work together in tissues called muscles {Figure 2). Muscles contract and relax in pairs to move the bones of the skeleton, so vertebrates can move on land and in water, and in some cases fly.
Smooth muscle cells form one of the layers of tissue in your digestive system and they contract to squeeze the food through your gut. Striated muscle celIs have three main adaptations:  They contain special proteins that slide over each other making the fibers contract. They contain many mitochondria to transfer the energy needed for the chemical( reactions that take place as the cells contract and relax. They can store glycogen, a chemical that can be broken down and used in cellular respiration by the mitochondria to transfer the energy needed for the fibers to contract.  Sperm cells are usually released a long way from the egg they are going to fertilise.They contain the genetic information from the male parent. Depending on the type of animal, sperm cells need to move through water or the female reproductive system to reach an egg. Then they have to break into the egg.  Sperm cells have several adaptations to make all this possible (Figure 3):  A long tail whips from side to side to help move the sperm through
water or the female reproductive system. The middle section is full of mitochondria, which transfer the energy
needed for the tail to work.  The acrosome stores digestive enzymes for breaking down the outer layers of the egg. o	A large nucleus contains the genetic information to be passed on.","Name one adaption for the specialised nerver cell and describe how this adaption helps the cell carry out its function ?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Specialisation in plant cells,"Animals are not the only organisms to have cells specialized for a particular function within a tissue or an organ. Plants also have very specialized cells with clear adaptations for the job they carry out.
Here are four examples. You find root hair cells close to the tips of growing roots. Plants need to take in lots of water (and dissolved mineral ions). the root hair cells help them to take up water and mineral ions more efficiently. Root hair cells are always relatively close to the xylem tissue. The xylem tissue carries water and mineral ions up into the rest of the plant. Mineral ions are moved into the root hair cell by active transport (Topic B1.9).
Root hair cells (Figure 1) have three main adaptations: They greatly increase the surface area available for water to move into the well. They have a large permanent vacuole that speeds up the movement of water by osmosis from the soil across the root hair cell.  They have many mitochondria that transfer the energy needed for the active transport of mineral ions into the root hair cells.  One of the ways plants offer from animals is that plants can make their own food by photosynthesis. There are lots of plant cells that can carry out photosynthesis — and lots that cannot. Photosynthetic cells (Figure 2) usually Haye a number of adaptations including:  They contain specialized green structures called chloroplasts containing chlorophyll that trap the light needed for photosynthesis. They are usually positioned in continuous layers in the leaves and outer layers of the stem of a plant so they absorb as much light as possible.  They have a large permanent vacuole that helps keep the cell rigid as a result of osmosis (Topic BI.8). When lots of these rigid cells are arranged together to form photosynthetic tissue, they help support the stem.They also keep the leaf spread out so it can capture as much light as possible. Xylem is the transport tissue in plants that carries water and mineral ions from the roots to the highest leaves and shoots. The xylem is also important to supporting the plant.The xylem is made up of xylem cells (Figure 3) that are adapted to their functions in two main ways: o	The xylem cells are alive when they are first formed but a special chemical called lignin builds up in spirals in the cell walls. The cells die and form long hollow tubes that allow water and mineral ions to move easily through them, from one end of the plant to the other. The spirals and rings of lignin in the xylem cells make them very strong and help them withstand the pressure of water moving up the plant. They also help support the plant stem. Ph!oem is the specialized transport tissue that carries the food made by photosynthesis around the body of the plant. It is made up of phloem cells that form tubes rather like xylem cells, but phloem cells do not become lignified and die. The dissolved food can move up and down the phloem tubes to where it is needed. The adaptations of the phloem cells (Figure 4) include:  The cell walls between the cells break down to form special sieve plates These allow water carrying dissolved food to move freely up and down the tubes to where it is needed. Phloem cells lose a lot of their internal structures but they are supported by companion cells that help to keep them alive.The mitochondria of the companion cells transfer the energy needed to move dissolved food up and down the plant in phloem.

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Diffusion,"Your cells need to take in substances such as glucose and oxygen for respiration. They also need to get rid of waste products, and chemicals that are needed elsewhere in your body. Dissolved substances and gases can move into and out of your cells across the cell membrane One of the main ways in which they move is by diffusion. Diffusion is the spreading out of the particles of a gas, or of any substance in solution (a solute). This results in the net movement (overall movement) of particles. The net movement is from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration of the particle. It takes place because of the random mmovement of the particles (molecules or ions), The motion of the particles causes them to bump into each other, and this moves them all around. Imagine a room containing a group of boys on one side and a group of girls on the other. If everyone closes their eyes and moves around briskly but randomly, they will bump into each other. They will scatter until the room contains a mixture of boys and girls.This gives you a good model of diffusion. If there is a big difference in concentration between two areas, diffusion will take place quickly. Many particles will move randomly towards  the area of low concentration. Only relatively few will move randomly in the owner direction. However, if there is only a small difference in concentration between two
areas, the net movement by diffusion will be quite slow. The number of particles moving into the area of lower concentration by random movement will only be slightly more than the number of particles that are leaving the area. In general, the greater the difference in concentration, the faster the rate of diffusion. This difference between two areas of concentration is called the concentration gradient. The bigger the difference, the steeper the concentration gradient and the faster the rate of diffusion. In other words, diffusion occurs down a concentration gradient.  Temperature also affects the rate of diffusion. An increase in temperature means the particles in a gas or a solution move around more quickly.
When this happens, diffusion takes place more rapidly as the random movement of the particles speeds up. Dissolved substances move into and out of your cells by diffusion across the cell membrane. These include simple sugars, such as glucose, gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and waste products such as urea from the breakdown of amino acids in your liver. The urea passes from the liver cells into the blood plasma and is excreted by the kidneys. The oxygen you need for respiration passes from the air in your lungs into your red blood cells through the cell membranes by diffusion. The oxygen moves down a concentration gradient from a region of high oxygen concentration to a region of low oxygen concentration.
Oxygen then also moves by diffusion down a concentration gradient from the blood cells into the cells of the body where it is needed. Carbon dioxide moves out from the body cells into the red blood cells and then into the air in the lungs by diffusion down a concentration gradient in
a similar way. The diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide in opposite
directions in the lungs is known as gas exchange.
Individual cells may be adapted to make diffusion easier and more rapid. The most common adaptation is to increase the surface area of the cell membrane (Figure 2). By folding up the membrane of a cell, or the tissue lining an organ, the area over which diffusion can take place is greatly increased. Therefore the rate of diffusion is also greatly increased, so that much more of a substance moves in a given time.","Explain why diffusion takes place faster when there is an increase in temperature?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Osmosis,"Diffusion takes place when particles can spread out freely from a higher to a lower concentration. However, the solutions inside cells are separated from those outside by the cell membrane. This membrane does not let
all types of particles through. Membranes that only let some types of panicles through are called partially permeable membranes. Partially permeable cell membranes let water move across them. Remember:  A dilute solution of sugar contains a high concentration of water ( the solvent). It has a low concentration of sugar (the solute).  A concentrated sugar solution contains a relatively low concentration of water and a high concentration of sugar. The cytoplasm of a cell is made up of chemicals dissolved in water inside a partially permeable cell membrane. The cytoplasm contains a fairly concentrated solution of salts and sugars Water moves from a dilute solution (with a high concentration of water molecules) to a concentrated solution (with fewer water molecules in a given volume) across the membrane of the cell. This special type of diffusion, where only water moves across a partially permeable membrane from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution is called osmosis. The concentration of solutes inside your body cells needs to stay at the same level for them to work properly. However, the concentration of the solutions outside your cells may be very different to the concentration inside them, This concentration gradient can cause water to move into or out of the cells by osmosis.  If the concentration of solutes in the solution outside the cell is the same as the internal concentration, the solution is isotonic to the cell.  If the concentration of solutes in the solution outside the cell is higher than the internal concentration, the solution is hypertonic to the cell. If the concentration of solutes in the solution outside the cell is lower than the internal concentration, the solution is hypotonic to the cell. If a cell uses up water in its chemical reactions, the cytoplasm becomes more concentrated. The surrounding fluid becomes hypotonic to the cell and more water immediately moves in by osmosis.
If the cytoplasm becomes too dilute because more water is made in chemical reactions, the surrounding fluid becomes hypertonic to the cell and water leaves the cell by osmosis. Osmosis restores the balance in both cases. However, osmosis can also cause big problems If the solution outside the cell becomes much more dilute (hypotonic) than the cell contents, water will move in by osmosis. The cell will swell and may burst. If the solution outside the Cell becomes much more concentrated (hypertonic) than the cell contents, water will move out of the cell by osmosis. The cytoplasm will become too concentrated and the cell will shrivel up and can no longer survive. Once you understand the effect osmosis can have on cells, the importance of maintaining constant internal conditions becomes clear.","Explain the difference between osmosis and diffusion ?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Osmosis in plants,"As you have seen, osmosis is the movement of water through a partially permeable membrane down a water concentration gradient. The effect of osmosis on animal cells can be dramatic. Animals nave many complex ways of controlling the concentrations of their body solutions to prevent cell damage as a result of osmosis. In plants, osmosis is key to their whole way of life. Plants rely on osmosis to support their stems and leaves. Water moves
into plant cells by osmosis. This causes the vacuole to swell, which presses the cytoplasm against the plant cell wall. The pressure builds up until
no more water can physically enter the cell — this pressure is known as turgor, Turgor pressure makes the cells hard and rigid, which in turn keeps the leaves and stems of the pIant rigid and firm.
Plants need the fluid surrounding the cells is always be hypotonic to the cytoplasm, with a lower concentration of solutes and a higher
concentration of water than the plant cells themselves, This keeps water moving by osmosis in the right direction and the cells are turgid. If the solution surrounding the plant cells is hypertonic to (more concentrated than) the cell contents, water will leave the cells by osmosis. The cells will no longer be firm and swollen — they become flaccid (soft) as there is no pressure on the cell walls. At this point, the plant wilts as turgor no Ionge r supports the plant tissues.
If more water is lost by osmosis , the vacuole and cytoplasm sshrink, and eventually the cell membrane pulls away from the cell wall. This is
plasmolysis. Plasmolysis is usually only seen in laboratory experiments. Plasmolysed cells die quickly unless the osmotic balance is restored.","Suggest why Osmosis is so important in the structural support system in plants?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Active transport,"People with cystic fibrosis have thick, sticky mucus in their lungs, gut and reproductive systems. This causes many different health problems and it happens because an active transport system in their mucus-producing cells does not work properly, Sometimes diffusion and osmosis are not enough. AIl cells need to move substances in and out. Water often moves across the cell boundaries by osmosis. Dissolved substances also need to move in and out of cells. There are two main ways in which this happens. Substances move by diffusion, down a concentration gradient.
This must be in one right direction to be useful in the cells. Sometimes the substances needed by a cell have to be moved against a concentration gradient, across a partially permeable membrane. This needs a special process called active transport. Active transport allows cells to move substances from an area of low concentration to an area of nigh concentration. This movement is against the concentration gradient. As a result, cells can absorb ions from very dilute solutions. It also enables cells to move substances, such as sugars and ions, from one place to another through the cell membrane.
Energy is needed for the active transport system to carry a molecule across the membrane and then return to its original position. This energy is produced during cell respiration. Scientists have shown in a number of different cells that the rate of respiration and the rate of active transport are closely linked.
In other words, if a cell respites and releases a lot of energy, it can carry out lots of active transport. Examples include root hair cells in plants and the cells lining your put. Cells involved in a lot of active transport usually have many mitochondria to release the energy they need. Active transport is widely used in cells. There are some situations where it is particularly important. For example, mineral ions in the soil, such as nitrate ions, are usually found in very dilute solutions. These solutions are more dilute than the solution within the plant root hair cells. By using active transport, plants can absorb these mineral ions, even though it is against a concentration gradient .
Sugar, such as glucose, is always actively absorbed out of your gut and kidney tubu1es into your blood. This is often done against a large concentration gradient. For example, glucose is needed for cell respiration, so it is important to get as much as possible out of the gut. The concentration of glucose in your blood is kept steady, so sometimes it is higher than the concentration of glucose in your gut. When this happens, active transport is used to move the glucose from your gut into your blood against the concentration gradient.","Describe how active transport differs from diffusion and osmosis?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Strucuture and transport,Exchanging materials,"For many single-celled organisms, diffusion, osmosis, and active transport are all that is needed to exchange materials with their environment because they have a relatively large surface area compared to the volume of the cell. This allows sufficient transport of molecules into and out of the cell to meet the needs of the organism. The surface area to volume ratio is very important in biology. It makes a big difference to the way animals can exchange substances with the environment. Surface area to volume ratio is also important when you consider how energy is transferred by living organisms, and how water evaporates from the surfaces of plants and animals. As living organisms get bigger and more complex, their surface area to volume ratio gets smaller. This makes it increasingly difficult to exchange
 materials quickly enough with the outside world.  Gases and food molecules can no Ionger reach every cell inside the organism by simple diffusion. øMetabolic waste cannot be removed fast enough to avoid poisoning the cells. In many larger organisms, there are special surfaces where the exchange of materials takes place. These surfaces are adapted to be as effective as possible. You can find them in humans, in other animals, and in plants. There are various adaptations to make the process of exchange more efficient. The effectiveness of an exchange surface can be increased by:  having a large surface area over which exchange can take place, having a thin membrane or being thin to provide a short diffusion path, in animals, having an efficient blood supply moves the diffusing substances away from the exchange surfaces and maintains a steep concentration (diffusion) gradient, in animals, being ventilated makes gas exchange more efficient by maintaining steep concentration gradients. Different organisms have very different adaptations for the exchange of material. For example, the Australian Fitzroy river turtle (locally known as the bum-breathing turtle) can ‘breathe’ underwater. Inside the rear opening are two large sacs lined with finger-like folds which provide a large surface area and rich blood supply for gas exchange. The muscular opening pumps water in and out, ventilating the folds and maintaining a steep concentration gradient for gas exchange. The human surface area to volume ratio is so low that the cells inside your body cannot possibly get the food and oxygen they need, or get rid	of the waste they produce, by simple diffusion. Air is moved into and out
of your lungs when you breathe, ventilating the millions of tiny air sacs called alveoli. The alveoli have an enormous surface area and a very rich blood supply, for effective gas exchange. The villi of the small intestine also provide a large surface area, short diffusion paths and a rich blood supply to make exchange of materials more effective.
Fish need to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between their blood and the water in which they swim, This happens across the gills, which
are made up of stacks of thin filaments, each with a rich blood supply. Fish need a constant flow of water over their gills to maintain the concentration gradients needed for gas exchange. They get this by pumping water over the gills using a flap that covers the gills called the operculum.
Plant roots have a large surface area, made even bigger by the root hair cells, to make the uptake of water and mineral ions more efficient.
Water constantly moves away from the roots in the transpiration stream, maintaining a steep concentration gradient in the cells. Plant leaves are also modified to make gas and solute exchange as elective as possible. Flat, thin leaves, the presence of air spaces in the leaf tissues, and the stomata all help to provide a big surface area and maintain a steep concentration gradient for the diffusion of substances such as water, mineral ions, and carbon dioxide.","

Cells and Organisms,Cell Division,Cell division,"New cells are needed for an organism, or part of an organism, to grow. They are also needed to replace cells that become worn out and to repair damaged tissue. However , the new cells must have the same genetic information as the originals so they Can do the same job. Each of your cells has a nucleus that contains chromosomes. Chromosomes carry the genes that contain the instructions for making both new cells and all the tissues and organs needed to make an entire new you.
A gene is a small packet of information that controls a characteristic, or part of a characteristic, of your body. It is a section of DNA, the unique molecule that makes up your chromosomes.
Most of your characteristics are the result of many different genes rather than a single gene. The genes are grouped together on chromosomes. A chromosome may carry several hundred or even thousands of genes.
You have 46 chromosomes in the nucleus of your body cells. They are arranged in 23 pairs . In each pair of chromosomes, one chromosome i5 inherited from the father and one from the mother. As such, sex cells (gametes) only have one chromosome from each pair, so only have 23 chromosomes in total. Body cells divide in a series of stages known as the cell cycle (Figure 2). Cell division in the cell cycle involves a process called mitosis and it produces two identical cells. As a result, all your normal body cells have the same chromosomes and so the same genetic information. Cell division by mitosis produces the additional cells needed for growth and development in multicellular organisms, and for the replacement of worn out or damaged cells.
In asexual reproduction, the cells of the offspring are produced by mitosis from the cells of their parent. This is why they contain exactly the same genes as their parent with little or no genetic variation. The length of the cycle varies considerably. It can take less than 24 hours, or it can take several years, depending on the cells involved and the stage of life of the organism. The cell cycle is short as a baby develops before it is born, when new cells are being made all the time. It remains fairly rapid during childhood, but the cell cycle slows down once puberty is over and the body is adult. However, even in adults, there are regions where there is continued growth or a regular replacement of cells. They include the hair follicles, the skin, the blood, and the lining of the digestive system.  The cell cycle in normal, healthy cells follows a regular pattern:  Stage 1: this is the longest stage in the cell cycle. The cells grow bigger, increase their mass, and carry out normal cell activities. Most importantly they replicate their DNA to form two copies of each chromosome ready for cell division. They also increase the number of sub-cellular structures such as mitochondria, ribosomes and chloroplasts ready for the cell to divide. Stage 2 — Mitosis: in this process one set of chromosomes is pulled to each end of the dividing cell and the nucleus divides. Stage 3: this is the stage during which the cytoplasm and the cell membranes also divide to form two identical daughter cells. In some parts of an animal or plant, mitotic cell division carries on rapidly all the time. For example, you constantly lose.cells from the skïn’s surface and make new cells to replace them. In fact. about 300 million of your body cells die every minute, so cell division by mitosis is very important. In a child, mitotic divisions produce new cells faster than the old ones die. As an adult, cell death and mitosis keep more or less in balance. When you get very old, mitosis slows down and you show the typical signs of ageing.","How quickly do viruses start in people?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Division,Growth and differentiation,"At the moment of conception, a potential new human being is just one cell. By the time you are an adult, scientists have estimated that your body will contain around 37.2 trillion cells — although estimates vary I om S to 100 trillion! Almost all of these cells are the result of mitosis,The growth that takes place is amazing. Growth is a permanent increase in size as a result of cell division or cell enlargement .
The cells of your body, or any complex muI1iceIIuIar organism, are not all the same. They are not the same as the original cell either. This is because, as cells divide, grow and develop, they also begin to differentiate. In the early development of animal and plant embryos, the cells a e unspecialized. Each one of them (known as a stem cell) can become any type of cell that is needed.
In animals, many types of cells become specialized very early in life. By the time a human baby is born, most of its cells are specialized to carry out
a particular job, such as nerve cells, skin cells, or muscle cells. They have differentiated. Some of their genes have been switched on and others have been switched off. As a result, different types of specialized cells have different sub-cellular structures to carry out specific functions.
Most specialized cells can divide by mitosis, but they can only form the same sort of cell. Muscle cells divide to produce more muscle cells, for example. Some differentiated cells, such as red blood cells and skin cells, cannot divide at all and so adult stem cells replace dead o damaged cells. Nerve cells do not divide once They have differentiated and they are not rreplaced by stem cells. AS a rresult, when nerve cells are damaged they are not usually replaced.
In a mature animal, little or no growth takes place. Cell division is almost entirely restricted to repair and replacement of damaged cells, and each differentiated cell type divides only to make more of the same cells. In contrast to animal cells, most plant cells are able to differentiate all through their lives. Undifferentiated Cells are formed at active regions of the stems and roots, known as the meristems. In these areas, mitosis takes place almost continuously. The cells then elongate and prow before they finally differentiate.
PIant5 keep growing all through their lives at these ‘growing points!
The plant  ceIIs produced do not differentiate until they are in their final position in the plant. Even then, the differentiation is not permanent. You can move a plant cell from one part of a plant to another. There it can redifferentiate and become a completely different ape of cell. You cannot do that with animal cells — once a muscle cell, always a muscle cell. Producing identical offspring is known as cloning. Huge numbers
of identical plant clones can be produced from a tiny piece of leaf tissue. This is because, in the right conditions, a plant cell will become unspecialized and undergo mitosis many times Each of these undifferentiated cells will produce more cells by mitosis. Given different conditions, these will then differentiate to form tissues such as xylem, phloem, photosynthetic cells, and root hair cells that are needed to form a tiny new plant. The new plant will be identical to the original parent
It is difficult to clone animals because, as you have seen, most animal cells differentiate permanently early in embryo development. The cells cannot change back. As a result, artificial animal clones can only be made by cloning embryos in some way, although adult cells can be used to make an embryo.","At the point of conception how many cells forms a human being?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Division,Stem cells,"An egg and sperm cell fuse to form a zygote, a single new cell. That cell
divides and becomes a hollow ball of cells - the embryo. The inner cells of this ball are the embryonic stem cells that differentiate to form all of the specialised cells of your body. Even when you are an adult, some of your stem cells remain. An adult stem cell is an undifferentiated cell of an organism that can give rise to many more cells of the same type. Certain owner types of cell can also arise from stern cells by differentiation. Your bone marrow is a good source of adult stem cells. Scientists now think there may be a tiny number of stem cells in most of the different tissues in your body including your blood, brain, muscle, and liver .
Many of your differentiated cells can divide to replace themselves. However, some tissues cannot do this and stem cells can stay in these tissues for years, only needed if the cells are injured or affected by disease. Then they start dividing to replace the different types of damaged cell. Many people suffer and even die because parts of their body stop working properly. For example, spinal injuries can cause paralysis, because the spinal nerves cannot repair themselves. People with type 1 diabetes have to inject themselves with insulin every day because specialised cells in their pancreas do not work. Millions of people would benefit if we could replace damaged or diseased body parts.
In 1998, there was a breakthrough. Two scientists managed to culture human embryonic stem cells, capable of forming other types of cell. Scientists hope that the embryonic stem cells can be encouraged to grow into almost any different type of cell needed in the body. Already scientists have used nerve cells grown from embryonic stem cells to restore some movement to the legs of paralyzed rats. In 2010, the first trials testing the safety of injecting nerve cells grown from embryonic stem cells into the spinal cords of paralysed human patients were carried out. The scientists and doctors hope it will not be long before they can use stem ceIIs to help people who have been paralysed to walk again. In 2014, doctors transplanted embryonic stem cells into the eyes of people going blind as  a resuIt of macular degeneration . lt was a small Study to check the Safety of the technique but all of the patients found they could see better. Larger trials are now taking place. Scientists are  also	different types of stem cells to try and grow cells that a e sensitive to blood sugar levels and produce the hormone insulin to help treat people with diabetes. We might also be able to grow whole new organs from embryonic stem cells. These could then be used in transplant surgery . Conditions from infertility to dementia could eventually be created using stern cells. The stem cells from plant meristems can be used to make clones of the mature parent plant very quickly and economically. This is important as it gives us a way of producing large numbers of rare plants reliably and safely. We may be able to save some rare plants from extinction in this way. Plant cloning also gives us a way of producing large populations of identical plants for research. This is important as scientists can change variables and observe the effects on genetically identical individuals.
Cloning large numbers of identical plants from the stem cells in plant meristems is also widely used in horticulture producing large numbers of plants such as orchids for sale . In agriculture it is used to
produce large numbers of identical crop plants with special features, such as disease resistance. For example, every banana you eat is produced by a cloned plant.","Identify the differences between a stem cell and a normal body cell?

Cells and Organisms,Cell Division,Stem cell dilemmas,"As you saw in Topic 82.3, there are many potential benefits in using stem cells in human medicine and they are gradually being used to treat
real patients. However, the technology is still very new so there are still practical risks as well as social and ethical issues raised by the use of stem ceIIs in both medical research and in treatments. Many embryonic stem cells come from aborted embryos. Others come from spare embryos from fertility treatment, donated because they will not otherwise be used. Some people question the use of a potential human being as a source of cells, even to cure others. Some people feel that, as the embryo cannot give permission, using it is a violation of its human rights. The religious beliefs of others mean they cannot accept any interference with the process of human reproduction.
In addition, progress in developing therapies using embryonic stem cells has been relatively slow, difficult, expen5ive, and hard to control. However, it is ea5y to forget that scientists have only been working with them for around 20 years. The signals that control cell differentiation are still not completely understood. Not surprisingly it is proving difficult to persuade embryonic stem cells to differentiate into the type of cells needed to
treat patients.
Embryonic stem cells divide and grow rapidly. This is partly why they are potentially so useful but there is some concern that embryonic stem cells might cause cancer if they are used to treat people. This has sometimes been a problem when they have been used to treat mice and in early human treatments for autoimmune diseases.
There is a risk that adult stem cells might be infected with viruses, and so could transfer the infections to patients. If stem cells from an adult are used to treat another unrelated person, they may trigger an immune response. The patient may need to take immunosuppres5ant drugs to stop their body rejecting the new cells. Scientists hope embryonic Item cells will solve this problem. The body of a mother does not reject the embryo, so they hope that embryonic stem cells will not be rejected by the patient.
Some people feel that a great deal of money and time is being wasted on stem cell research that would be better spent on research into omen areas of medicine, Yet in spite of all these concerns, there is a lot of investment into stem cell research as many scientists and doctors are convinced stem cells have the potential to benefit many people. Scientists have found embryonic stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of
newborn babies and even in the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus as it grows. Using these instead of cells from spare embryos may help to overcome some of the ethical concerns about their use. Scientists are also finding ways of growing adult stem cells, although so far they nave only managed to develop them into a limited range of cell types. Adult stem cells avoid the controversial use of embryonic tissue. They have been used successfully to treat some forms of heart disease and to grow some new organs such as tracheas (windpipes).
The area of stem cell research known as therapeutic cloning (Figure 2) has much potential but is proving very difficult. It involves using cells from an adult to produce a cloned early embryo of themselves. Tins would provide a source of perfectly matched embryonic stem cells. In theory, these could then be used for medical treatments such as growing new
organs for the original donor. The new organs would not be rejected by the body because they have been made from the body’s own cells and have the same genes.
Scientists have discovered stem cells in some of the tubes them connect the liver and the pancreas to the small intestine. They have managed to make these cells turn into the special insulin-producing cells in the pancreas that a e so important for controlling blood sugar, These are the cells that are missing or destroyed in people with type 1 diabetes.
Scientists have transplanted these modified stem cells into diabetic mice, which worked to control the blood sugar levels. The next stage is to work towards the same success in humans.
At the moment, after years of ‹relatively slow progress, hopes are high again that stem cells will change the future of medicine. Currently, in the UK, stem cell research is being carried out into potential therapies to treat: Spinal cord injuries, diabetes, heart after damage in a heart attack, eyesight in the blind, damaged bone and cartilage.","Give an example of where the use of stem cells could provide new treatments ?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,Tissues and organs,"As you have seen, cells are the basic building blocks of all living organisms. Unicellular and simple multicellular organisms carry out all the exchanges they need across their cell membranes Large multicellular organisms may contain billions of cells and they have to overcome the problems linked
to their size. They have evolved different ways of exchanging materials. During 1he development of a multicellular organism, cells differentiate, becoming specialised to carry out particuiar jobs. However, the adaptations of multicellular organisms go beyond specialised cells. Similar specialised cells are often found grouped together to form a tissue. A tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function working together. For example, muscular tissue can contract to bring about movement (Figure 1). Glandular tissue contains secretory cells that can produce and release substances such as enzymes and hormones Epithelial tissue covers the outside of your body as well as your internal organs. Organs are collections of tissues. Each organ Contains several tissues,
all working together to perform a specific function. For example, the stomach, as shown in Figure 3, is an organ involved in the digestion of food. It Contains: muscular tissue, to churn the food and digestive juices of the stomach together, glandular tissue, to produce the digestive juices that break down food , epithelial tissue, which covers the inside and the outside of the organ. The pancreas is an organ that has two important functions. It makes hormones to control blood sugar, as well as some of the enzymes that digest food. It contains two very different types of tissue, which produce these different secretions . A whole multicellular organism is made up of a number of organ systems working together. Organ systems are groups of organs that all work together to perform specific functions. The way in which one organ functions often depends on other organs in the system. Organ
systems work together to form organisms. Organ systems in the human body include the digestive system, the circulatory system, and the gas exchange system. All of these systems have adaptations in some of their organs that make them effective as exchange surfaces. These adaptations include features to increase the surface area of part of an organ system,
a rich blood supply to areas where exchange takes place, areas with short diffusion distances for exchange, and mechanisms to increase the concentration gradients by ventilating surfaces or moving materials on.","Define the word tissue ?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,The human digestive system,"Your digestive system is between 6 and 9m long - 9 million times or 6 order of magnitude longer than the average human cell. The digestive system of humans and other mammals exchanges substances with the environment. The food you take in and eat is made up of large insoluble molecules. Your body cannot absorb and use these molecules. They need to be broken down or digested to form smaller, soluble molecules that can then be absorbed and used by your cells. This process of digestion takes place in your digestive system, one of the major organ systems of the body. The digestive system is one of the major organ systems of the body. The digestive system is a muscular tube that squeezes your food through it. It starts at one end with your mouth, and finishes at the other with your anus. The digestive system contains many different organs. There are glands such as the pancreas and salivary gland. These glands make and release digestive juices called enzymes to break down your food. The stomach and the small intestine are the main organs where food is digested. Enzymes breakdown the large insoluble food molecules into smaller, soluble ones. Your small intestine is also where the soluble food molecules are absorbed into your blood. Once there, they get transposed in the bloodstream around your body. The small intestine is adapted to have a very large surface area as it is covered in villi.It also has a good blood supply and short diffusion distances to the blood vessels. This greatly increases diffusion and active transport from the small intestine to the blood.

The muscular walls of the small intestine squeeze the undigested food onwards into your large intestine. This is where water is absorbed from the undigested food into your blood. The material left forms the faeces. Faeces are stored and then pass out of your body through the rectum and anus back into the environment.
Other organs associated with the digestive system include the liver.The liver is a large organ that carries out many different functions in your body.The function of the liver that is most closely linked to the digestive system is the production of bile, which helps in the digestion of lipids.","Describe the function of the Liver?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,The chemistry of food,"Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are the main compounds that make up the structure of a cell. They are vital components in the balanced diet of any organism that cannot make its own food. Carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins are all large molecules that are open made up by smaller molecules joined together as part of the cell metabolism. Carbohydrates Provide us with the fuel that makes all of the other reactions of life possible. They contain the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. AII carbohydrates are made up of units of sugars:  Some carbohydrates contain only one sugar unit, The best known of these single sugars is glucose, C,HI 2	Other Carbohydrates are
made up of two sugar units joined together, for example sucrose, the
compound we call ‘sugar’ in everyday life. These small carbohydrate units are referred to as simple sugars. Complex carbohydrates such as starch and cellulose are made up of long chains of simple sugar units bonded together. Carbohydrate-rich foods include bread, Potatoes, rice, and pasta. MO5t of the carbohydrates you eat will be broken down to glucose used in
cellular respiration to provide energy for metabolic reactions in your cells. The carbohydrate cellulose is an important support materiaI in plants. Lipids are fats (solids) and oils (liquids). They are the most efficient energy store in your body and an important source of energy in your diet.  Combined with other molecules, lipids are very important in your cell membranes, as hormones, and in your nervous system. Like carbohydrates, Iipids are made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. All lipids are insoluble in water. Lipids are made up of three molecules of fatty acids joined to a molecule of glycerol. The glycerol is always the same, but the fatty acids vary. . Lipid-rich food includes all the oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, as well as butter, margarine, cheese, and cream. The different combination of fatty acids affects whether the lipid will be a liquid oil or a solid fat. Proteins are used for building up the cells and tissues of your body, as well
as the basis of all your enzymes Between 1S and 1695 of your body mass is protein. Protein is found in tissues ranging from your hair and nails to the muscles that move you around and the enzymes that control your body chemistry. Proteins are made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Protein-rich foods include meat, fish, pulses, and cheese.
A protein molecule is made up of long chains of small units called amino acids .There are around 20 different amino acids, and they are joined together into long chains by special bonds. Different arrangements of the various amino acids give you different proteins. The long chains of amino acids that make up a protein are folded, coiled, and twisted to make specific 3D shapes. It is these specific shapes that enable other molecules to fit into the protein.The bonds that hold the proteins in these 3D shapes are very sensitive to temperature and pH, and can easily be broken. If this happens, the shape of the protein is lost and it
 
may not function any more in your cells. The protein is denatured. Proteins carry out many different functions in your body. They act as : strucural components of tissues such as muscles and tendons, hormones such as insulin, antibodies, enzymes.","Explain what a protein is?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,Catalysts and enzymes,"In everyday life, you control the rate of chemical reactions all the time. You increase the temperature of your oven to speed up chemical reactions when you cook, and you cool food down in the fridge to slow down the reactions that cause food to go off.
Sometimes people use special Chemicals known as catalysts to speed up reactions. A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction, but it is not used up in the reaction. You Can use a Catalyst over and over again. In your body, the rate of chemical reactions is controlled by enzymes.
These are special biological catalysts that speed up reactions. Each enzyme interacts with a particular substrate ( reactant).
Enzymes are large protein molecules. The shape of an enzyme is vital
for the enzyme to function. The long chains of amino acids are folded to produce a molecule with an active site that has a unique shape so it can bind to a Specific substrate molecule. The lock and key theory is a simple model of how enzymes work The substrate of the reaction to be catalyzed fits into the active site of the enzyme. You can mink of it like a lock and key. Once it is in place, the enzyme and the substrate bind together, The reaction then takes place rapidly and the products are reIeased from the surface of the enzyme (Figure 2). Remember that enzymes can join small molecules together as well as break up large one5. The e are other, more complex models of how enzymes work but they are all based on the lock and key theory. Enzymes do not change a reaction in any way, they just make it happen faster. Enzymes Control the metabolism — that is the sum of all the reactions in a cell or in the body. Different enzymes catalyze (speed up) specific types of metabolic reactions: Building  large molecules from lots of smaller ones. This includes building starch, glycogen or Cellulose from glucose; lipids from fatty acids; or proteins from amino acids. Plant cells also combine carbon dioxide and water to make glucose, and use glucose and nitrate ions to make amino acids. Changing one molecule into another. This includes changing one simple sugar into another, such as glucose to fructose, and converting one amino acid into another. Breaking down ledge molecules into smaller ones. This includes breaking down carbohydrates, Iipids, and proteins into their constituent molecules during digestion; breaking down glucose in cellular respiration; and breaking down excess amino acids to form urea, and other molecules that can be used in respiration. Each of your cells can have a hundred or more chemical reactions going on within it at any one time. Earn of the different types of reaction is controlled by a different specific enzyme. Enzymes deliver the control that makes it possible for your cell chemistry to work without one reaction interfering with another.","Define a catalyst ?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,Factors affecting enzyme action,"A container of milk left at the back of your fridge for a week or two will
be disgusting. The  milk will go  off as enzymes in bacteria break down the protein structure. Leave your milk in the sun for a day and the same thing happens — but much faster. Temperature affects the rate at which chemical reactions take place, even when they are controlled by biological catalysts
Biological reactions are affected by the same factors as any other chemical reactions These factors include concentration, temperature, and surface area. However, in living organisms, an increase in temperature only increases the rate of reaction up to a certain point. The reactions that take place in cells happen at relatively low temperatures. As with other reactions, the rate of enzyme-controlled reactions increases as the temperature increases.
However, for most organisms this is only true up to temperatures of about 40°C. After this, the protein structure of the enzyme is affected by the high temperature. The long amino acid chains begin to unravel, and as a result, the shape of the active site changes. The substrate will no longer fit in the active site.The enzyme is said to have been denatured. It can no longer act as a catalyst, so the rate of the reaction drops dramatically. Most human enzymes work best at 37°C, which is human body temperature.
Without enzymes, none of the reactions in your body would happen fast enough to keep you alive.This is why it is dangerous if your temperature goes too high when you are ill. Once your body temperature reaches about 41 °C, your enzymes stan to be denatured, which will result in death. Not all enzymes work best at around 40°C. Bacteria living in hot springs survive at temperatures up to 80°C and higher . On the other hand, some bacteria that live in the very cold, deep seas have enzymes that work effectively at 0°C and below. The shape of the active site of an enzyme comes from forces between the different parts of the protein molecule. These forces hold the folded chains in place. A change in pH affects these forces. That’s why it changes the shape of the molecule. As a result, the specific shape of the active site is lost, so the enzyme no longer acts as a catalyst, Different enzymes work best at different pH levels. A change in pH can stop them working completely.","Describe the effect of temperature on an enzyme-controlled reaction.

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,How the digestive system works,"The food you take in and eat is made up of large insoluble molecules, including starch (a carbohydrate), Proteins, and fats. Your body cannot absorb and use these molecules, so they need to be broken down or digested to form smaIIer , soluble molecules. These can then be absorbed in your small intestine and used by your cells. It is this chemical breakdown of your food that is controlled by the digestive enzymes in your digestive system. Most of your enzymes work inside the cells of your body, controlling the rate of the chemical reactions. Your digestive enzymes are different.
They work outside your cells, They are produced by specialized cells in glands (such as your salivary glands and your pancreas), and in the lining of your digestive system. The enzymes then pass out of these cells into the digestive system itself, where they come to contact with food molecules.
Your digestive system is a hollow, muscular tube that squeezes your food. It helps to break Up your food into small pieces that nave a large surface area for your enzymes to work on, It mixes your food with your digestive juices so that the enzymes come into contact with as much of the food as possible. The muscles of the digestive system move your food along from one area to the next, Different areas of the digestive system have different pH levels which allow the enzymes in that region to work as efficiently as possible, For example, the mouth and small intestine are slightly alkaline, while the stomach has a low, acidic pH value. Enzymes that break down carbohydrates are CaI1ed carbohydrases. Starch is one of the most common carbohydrates that you eat. lt is broken down into Sugars in your mouth and small intestine.This reaction iS Catalyzed by an enzyme called amylase.
Amylase is produced in your salivary glands, so the digestion of starch starts in your mouth. Amylase is also made in the pancreas. No digestion takes place inside the pancreas. All the enzymes made there flow into your small intestine, where most of the starch you eat is digested. The breakdown of protein foods such as meat, fish, and cheese into amino acids is catalyzed by Proteases enzymes. Proteases are produced by your stomach, your pancreas, and your small intestine. The breakdown of proteins into amino acids takes place in your stomach and small intestine. The lipids (fats and oils) that you eat are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol in the small intestine. The reaction is catalysed by lipase
enzymes, which are made in your pancreas and your Small intestine. Again, the enzymes made in the pancreas are passed into the small intestine. Once your food molecules have been completely digested into soluble glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and glycerol, they leave your small intestine. They pass into your bloodstream to be carried around the body to the cells that need them.
Discovering the roles of the different areas of the digestive system hasn‘t been easy. For example, when Alexis St Martin suffered a terrible gunshot wound in J 822, Dr William Beaumont managed to save his life. However, Alexis was left with a hole (or fistula) from his stomach to the outside world. Dr Beaumont then used this hole to find out what happened in Alexis's stomach as he digested food!","Describe where amylase is made in the body and which reaction it catalyzes ?

Cells and Organisms,Organisation and the digestive system,Making digestion efficient,"Your digestive system produces many enzymes that speed up the breakdown of the food you eat. As your body is kept at a fairly steady 37°C, your enzymes have an optimum temperature that allows them to work as fast as possible.
Keeping the pH in your digestive system at optimum levels isn’t that easy, because different enzymes work best at different pH levels. For example, the protease enzyme found in your stomach works best in acidic conditions, while the proteases made in your ppancreas need alkaline conditions to
work at their best. So, your body makes a variety of different chemicals that help to keep conditions ideal for your enzymes all the way through your digestive system. You have around 35 million glands in the lining of your stomach.These secrete pepsin, a protease enzyme. to digest the protein  you eat. Pepsin works best in an acidic pH. Your stomache also produces a relatively concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid from the same glands. In fact, your stomach produces around 3litres of hydrochloric acid a day! This acid allows your stomach protease enzymes to work very effectively. lt also kills most of the bacteria that you take in with your food.
Your stomach also produces a thick layer of mucus. This coats your stomach walls and protects them from being digested by the acid and the enzymes. If someone develops a stomach ulcer, the protecting mucus is lost and acId production may increase. The lining of the stomach is then attacked by the acid and the protein-digesting enzymes, which can be very painful.
After eating a meal, a few hours later — depending on the size and type of the meal — your food leaves your stomach. It moves on into your small intestine. Some of the enzymes that catalyze digestion in your small intestine are made in your pancreas. Some are also made in the small intestine itself. They all work best in an alkaline environment.
The acidic liquid coming from your stomach needs to become an alkaline mixture in your small intestine. So this can happen, your liver makes a green-yellow alkaline liquid called bile. Bile is stored in your gall bladder untiI it is needed.
As food Comes into the small intestine from the stomach, bile is squirted onto it through the bile duct. The bile neutralizes the acid that was added to the food in the stomach. This provides the alkaline conditions necessary for the enzymes in the small intestine to work most effectively. It is very important for the enzymes of the digestive system to have the largest Possible surface area of food to wo k on. This is not a problem with carbohydrates and proteins. However, the fats that you eat do not mix with all the watery liquids in your digestive system, They stay as large globules (like oil in water) that make it difficult for the Iipase enzymes to act. This is the second important function of the bile — it emulsifies the fats in your food. This means bile physically breaks up large drops of fat into
smaller droplets. This provides a much bigger surface area of fats for the lipase enzymes to act upon. The larger surface area helps the lipase chemically break down the fats more quickly into fatty acids and qlycerol. Sometimes gall stones form and they can block the gall bladder and bite ducts. The stones can range from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter and can cause terrible pain.They can also stop bile being released onto the food and reduce the efficiency of digestion.","Describe how bile results in a large surface area for lipase to work?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,The blood,"Multicellular organisms with a small surface area to volume ratio often have specialized transport systems. The human circulatory system consists of the blood, the blood vessels, and the heart. Your blood is a unique tissue, based on a liquid called plasma. Plasma carries red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets suspended in it. It also carries many dissolved substances around your body. The average person has between 4.7 and 5 litres of blood. Your blood plasma is a yellow liquid. The plasma transports all of your blood cells and some other substances around your body.  Waste carbon dioxide produced by the cells is carried to the lungs. Urea formed in your liver from the breakdown of excess proteins is carried to your kidneys where it is removed from your blood to form urine. The small, soluble products of digestion pass into the plasma from your small intestine and are transported to the individual cells. There are more red blood cells than any other type of blood cell in your body — about S million in each cubic millimetre of blood.These cells pick up oxygen from the air in your lungs and carry it to the cells where it is needed. Red blood cells have adaptations that make them very efficient at their job:  They are biconcave discs. Being concave (pushed in) on both sides, gives them an increased surface area to volume ratio for diffusion. They are packed with a red pigment called haemoglobin that binds
to oxygen.  They have no nucleus, making more space for haemoglobin. White blood cells are much bigger then red blood cells and there are fewer of  them.They have a nucleus and form part of the body’s defense system against harm1I microorganisms. Some white blood celIs (lymphocytes) form antibodies against microorganisms Some fbrm antitoxins against poisons made by microorganisms. Yet  others (phagocytes) engulf and digest invading bacteria and viruses. Platelets are small fragments of cells.They have no nucleus. They are
very important in helping the blood to clot at the site of a wound. Blood clotting is a series of enzyme-controlled reactions that result in converting fibrinogen into fibrin, This produces a network of protein fibers that capture lots of reel blood cells and more platelets to form a
jelly-like clot that stops you bleeding to death. The clot dries and hardens to form a scab. This protects the new skin as it grows and stops bacteria entering the body through the wound.","Name three functions of the blood?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,The blood vessels,"The substances transported in the blood need to reach the individual cells. Every cell in your body is within 0.05 mm of a capillary — the tiniest blood vessels in your circulatory system. Blood is carried around your body in three main types of blood vessels,
each adapted for a different function. •	Your arteries carry blood away I om your heart to the organs of your body. This blood is usually bright-red oxygenated blood. The arteries stretch as the blood is forced through them and go back into shape afterwards. You can feel this as a pulse where the arteries un close to the skin‘s surface (e.g., at your wrist). Arteries
have thick walls containing muscle and elastic fibres. As the blood
in the arteries is under pressure, it is very dangerous if an artery is cut, because me blood will spurt out rapidly every time the heart beats. Yhe veins carry blood away from the organs towards your heart. This blood is usually low in oxygen and therefore a deep purple red colour. Veins do not have a pulse. They have much thinner walls than arteries and often have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. The valves open as the blood flows through
them towards the heart, but if the blood starts to flow backwards the valves close and prevent a backflow of blood. The blood is squeezed back towards the heart by the action of the skeletal muscles. Throughout the body, capillaries form a huge network of tiny vessels linking the arteries and the veins. Capillaries are narrow with very thin walls. This enables substances, such as oxygen and glucose, to diffuse easily out of your blood and into your cells. The substances produced by your cells, such as carbon dioxide, Pass easily into the blood through the watts of the Capillaries. In your circulatory system, arteries carry blood away from your heart to the organs of the body. Blood returns to your heart in the veins.The two are linked by the capillary network. In humans and other mammals the blood vessels are arranged into a
double circulatory system, One transport system carries blood from your heart to your lungs and back again. This allows oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged with the air in the lungs. The other transport system carries blood from your heart to all other organs of your body and back again. A double circulation like this is vital in warm-blooded, active animals such as humans. It makes our circulatory system very efficient. Fully oxygenated blood returns to the heart from the lungs. This blood can then be sent off to different parts of the body at high pressure, so more areas of your body can receive fully oxygenated blood quickly.","Name the function of capillaries and describe how the structure of the blood vessel relates to its function?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,The heart,"Your heart is the organ that pumps blood around your body. It is made up of two pumps (for the double circulation) that beat together about 70 times each minute.The walls of your heart are almost entirely muscle. This muscle is supplied with oxygen by the coronary arteries. The structure of the human heart is perfectly adapted for pumping blood to your lungs and your body. The two sides of the heart fill and empty
at the same time, giving a strong, coordinated heartbeat. Blood enters the top chambers of your heart, which are called the atria. The blood coming into the right atrium from the vena cava is deoxygenated blood from your body, The blood coming into the left atirum in the pulmonary vein is oxygenated blood from your lungs. The atria contract together and force blood down into the ventricles. Valves close to stop the blood flowing backwards out of the heart. The ventricles contract and force blood out of the heart. The right ventricle forces deoxygenated blood to the lungs in the pulmonary artery. The left ventricle pumps oxygenated  blood around the body in a big artery called the aorta. As the blood is Dumped into the pulmonary artery and the aorta,
valves close to make sure the blood flows in the right  direction. The noise of the heartbeat you hear through a stethoscope is the sound of the valves of the heart closing to prevent blood flowing backwards. The muscle wall of the left ventricle is noiticebly thicker than the wall of the right ventricle. THis allows the left ventricle to develop the pressure needed to force tthe blood through the arterial system all over your body. The blood leaving the right ventricle moves through the pulmonary arteries to ytour lungs, where high pressure would damage the delicate capilarly network where gas exchange takes place. In Coronary heart disease the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle become narrow. A common cause is a buildup of fatty material on the fining of the vessels. If the blood flow through the
coronary arteries is reduced, the supply of oxygen to the heart muscle is also reduced. This can Cause pain, a heart attack, and even death. Doctors often solve the problem of coronary heart disease with a stent.
A stent is a metal mesh that is placed in the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to open up the blood vessel and the stent at the same time. The balloon
is deflated and removed but the stent remains in place, holding the blood vessel open, As soon as this is done, the blood in the coronary artery flows freely. Doctors can put a stent in place without a general anesthetic. Stents can be used to open up a blocked artery almost anywhere in the body. Many stents also release drugs to prevent the blood clotting, although some studies suggest that the benefits do not justify the additional expense. Doctors can also carry out bypass surgery, replacing the narrow or blocked coronary arteries with bin of veins from other parts of the body. This worn for badly blocked arteries where stents cannot help. The surgery is expensive and involves the risk associated with a general anesthetic, Increasingly doctors prescribe statins to anyone at risk from cardiovascular disease. They reduce blood cholesterol levels and this slows down the rate at which fatty material is deposited in the coronary arteries.","Blood in the arteries is usually bright red because it is full of oxygen, this is not true of the blood in the pulmonary arteries.

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Helping the heart,"The heart can be affected by a number of problems Doctors, scientists, and engineers have worked out some amazing ways to help solve them. Heart valves have to withstand a lot of pressure. Over time they may start to leak or become stiff and not open fully, making the heart less efficient. People affected may become breathless and without treatment, will eventually die. Doctors can operate and replace faulty heart valves. Mechanical valves are made of materials such as titanium and polymers. They last a very long time. However, with a mechanical valve you have to take medicine for the rest of your life to prevent your blood from clotting around it. Biological valves are based on valves taken from animals such as pigs or cattle, or even human donors. These work extremely well and the patient does not need any medication. The resting rhythm of a healthy heart is around 70 beats a minute. It is
controlled by a group of cells found in the right atrium of your heart that acts as your natural pacemaker. If the natural pacemaker stops working properly, this can cause Serious problems. If the heart beats too slowly, the person affected will not get enough oxygen. If the heart beats too fast, it cannot pump blood properly. Problems with the rhythm of the heart can often be solved using an artificial pacemaker.This is an electrical device used to correct
irregularities in the heart rate, which is implanted into your chest. Artificial pacemakers only weigh between 20 and 50g, and they are attached to your heart by two wires.The artificial pacemaker sends strong, regular electrical signals to your heart that stimulate it to beat properly. Modern pacemakers are often very sensitive to what your body needs and only work when the natural rhythm goes wrong. Some even stimulate the heart to beat faster when you exercise. If you have a pacemaker fitted, you will need regular medical check-ups throughout your life. However, most people feel that this is a small price to pay for the increase in the quality and length of life that a pacemaker brings. An artificial pacemaker may keep the heart beating steadily, but
sometimes it is not enough to restore a person’s health. When the heart fails completely, a donor ”heart or heart and lungs can be transplanted. When people need a heart transplant, they have to wait for a donor heart that is a tissue match. As a result of this wait, many people die before they get a chance to nave a transplant.
Scientists have developed temporary hearts that can support your natural heart until it can be replaced. Although replacing your heart permanently with a machine is still a long way off, by 2015 almost
500 people worldwide had been fitted with a completely artificial heart. These artificial hearts need a lot of machinery to keep them working.
Most patients have to stay in hospital until they have their transplant.
In the past few years artificial hearts have improved considerably although there is always a risk of the blood clotting in an artificial heart, which can lead to death. However, this new technology gives people
a chance to live a relatively normal life while they wait for a heart transplant. In 20a 1. 40-year-old Matthew Green became the first UK patient to leave hospital and go home with a completely artificial heart carried in a backpack.This kept him alive for two years until he had a heart transplant and no longer needed this life-saving machine.
Artificial hearts can also be used to give a diseased heart a rest, so that it can recover. Patients have a part or whole artificial heart implanted that  removes the strain of keeping the blood circulating for a few weeks or months, However, the resources needed to develop artificial hearts and the cost of each one means they are not yet widely used in patients.","Describe what a natural pacemaker is?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Breathing and gas exchange,"For a gas exchange system to work effciently, you need a large difference in concentrations of the gas on different sides of the exchange membrane (a steep concentration gradient). Many large animals, including humans, move air in and out of their lungs regularly. By changing the composition of the air in the lungs, they maintain a steep concentration gradient for both oxygen diffusing into the blood and carbon dioxide diffusing out
of the blood. This is known as ventilating the lungs or breathing. It takes place in a speciaIy adapted gas exchange system. Your lungs are found in your chest (or thorax) and are protected by your
ribcage. They are separated from the digestive organs beneath (in your abdomen) by the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a strong sheet of muscle. The job of your ventilation system is to move air in end out of your lungs, which provide an efficient surface for gas exchange in the alveoli .Ventilating the lungs is brought about by the contraction and
relaxation of the intercostal muscles between the ribs and the diaphragm, changing the pressure inside the chest cavity so air is forced in or out of the lungs as a result of differences in pressure. When you breathe in, oxygen-rich air moves into your lungs. This maintains a steep concentration gradient with the blood. As a result, oxygen continually diffuses into your bloodstream through the gas exchange surfaces of your alveoli. Breathing out removes carbon dioxide-rich air from the lungs.This maintains a concentration gradient so carbon dioxide can continually diffuse out of the bloodstream into the air in the lungs. Your lungs are specially adapted to make gas exchange more efficient. They are made up of clusters of alveoli that provide a very large surface area.This is important for achieving the most effective diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The alveoli also have a rich supply of blood capillaries. This maintains a concentration gradient in both directions. The blood coming to the lungs is always relatively low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide compared to the inhaled air.
As a result, pas exchange takes place down the steepest concentration gradients possible. This makes the exchange rapid and effective. The layer of cells between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries is also very thin (only one cell wide).This allows diffusion to take place over the shortest possible distance. If all of the alveoli in your lungs were spread out flat, they would have a surface area equivalent to 10—15 table tennis tables. ","Describe how air is moved in to and out of your lungs?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Tissues and organs in plants,"Elephant yarns are plants that produce a large flower that releases a disgusting stench like rotting meat that attracts carrion beetles. The beetles become trapped in the Power — its slippery, waxy walls stop them escaping. Around 24 hours after the stench is released, the flower releases pollen that coats the trapped beetles. Then the walls of the flower Change texture — they become rough so the beetles can crawl out, carrying the pollen to another flower, lured again by the powerful smell of dead meat. These flower are one type of plant organ — they are temporary and for reproduction only. But as you will see, plants have other organs, made up of combinations of many different tissues. The specialised cells in multicellular plants are organised into t issues and organs. Epidermal tissues cover the surfaces and protect them. These cells often secrete a waxy substance that waterproofs the surface of
the leaf.  Palisade mesophyll tissue contains lots of chloroplasts, which carry out photosynthesis, Spongy mesophyll tissue contains some chloroplasts for photosynthesis but also has big air spaces and a large surface area to make the diffusion of gases easier . Xylem and phloem are the transport tissues in plants. Xylem carry water and dissolved mineral ions from the roots up to the leaves and phloem carry dissolved food from the leaves around the plant. 
The meristem tissue at the growing tips of roots and shoots is made up of rapidly dividing plant cells that g ow and differentiate into all the other cell types needed. Within the body of a plant, specialises tissues such as palisade, spongy mesophyll, xylem, and phloem are arranges to form organs. Each organ carries out its own particular functions. The leaves, stems, and roots are all plant organs, each of which has a very specific job to do. within each plant organ there are collections of different tissues working together to perform specific functions for the organism. Plant organs can be very large indeed. For example, some trees, such as the giant redwood, have trunks over 40 m tall. A plant cell is about 100pm long.The plant stem is 400000 times bigger than an individual cell. The whole body of the plant — the roots, stem, and leaves — form an organ system for the transport of substances around the plant.Trees form the largest and oldest land organisms, so plant organ systems are also the biggest land based organ systems in the living world.","Explain how plants contain specialised tissues that are adapted to their function?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Transport systems in plants,"Plants make glucose (a simple sugar) by photosynthesis in the leaves and other green parts. This glucose is needed all over the plant.
Similarly, water and mineral ions move into the plant from the soil through the roots, but they are needed by every cell of the plant.
Plants have two separate transport systems to move substances around the whole plant.  The phloem tissue transports the sugars made by photosynthesis from the leaves to the rest of the plant. This includes transport to the growing areas of the stems and roots where the dissolved sugars are needed for making new plant cells. Food is also transported to the storage organs where it provides an energy store for the winter.
Phloem is a living tissue — the phloem cells are alive. The movement of dissolved sugars from the leaves to the rest of the plant is called translocation.
Greenfly and other aphids are plant pests. They push their sharp mouthparts right into the phloem and feed on the sugary fluid. If too many of them attack a plant, they can kill it by taking all of its food. The xylem tissue is the other transport tissue in plants, It carries water and
mineral ions from the soil around the plant to the stem and the leaves, Mature xylem cells are dead. In woody plants like trees, the xylem makes up the bulk of the wood and the phloem is found In a ring just underneath the bark. This makes young trees particularly vulnerable to damage by animals — if a complete ring of bark is eaten, transport in the phloem stops and the tree will die. It is vital to move the food made by photosynthesis around the plant —
all the cells need sugars for respiration as well as for providing materials for growth. The movement of water and dissolved mineral ions from the roots is equally important — the mineral ions are needed for the production of proteins and other molecules within the cells.
The plant needs water for photosynthesis, the process in which carbon dioxide and water combine to make glucose (plus oxygen). The plant also needs water to hold itself upright. When a cell has plenty of water inside it, the vacuole presses the cytoplasm against the cell walls. This pressure of the cytoplasm against the cell walls gives support for young plants and for the structure of the leaves. For young plants and soft- stem plants (although not trees) this is the main method of support.","Describe the main differences between the xylem and phloem in a plant.

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Evaporation and transpiration,"The top of a tree may be many meters from the ground. Yet the leaves at the top need water just as much as those on the lower branches. So how do they get the water they need ? All over the leaf surface are small openings known as stomata. The stomata can be opened when the plant needs to allow air into the leaves. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere diffuses into the air spaces and then into the cells down a concentration gradient. At the same time, oxygen produced by photosynthesis is removed from the leaf by diffusion into the surrounding air. This maintains a concentration gradient for oxygen to diffuse from the cells into the air spaces of the leaf. The size of the stomata and their opening and closing is controlled by the guard cells (Figure 1).
When the stomata are open, plants lose water vapor through them as well. The water vapor evaporates from the cells lining the air spaces and then passes out of the leaf throuph the stomata by diffusion.This loss of water vapour is known as transpiration.
As water evaporates from the surface of the leaves, more water is pulled up through the xylem to take its place. This constant movement of water molecules through the xylem from the roots to the leaves is known as the transpiration stream. It is driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves So, anything that affects the rate of evaporation will also affect transpiration. Most of the water vapour lost by plants is lost from the leaves. Most of this loss takes place by diffusion through the stomata when they are open.
This is one of the main reasons why it is important that plants can close their stomata — to limit the loss of water vapour.","What are stomata?

Cells and Organisms,Organising Animals and Plants,Factors affecting transpiration,"Different conditions affect the rate of transpiration — as a result, some
environments are much tougher for plants to survive in than others. Factors that affect the rate of transpiration include temperature, humidity, the amount of air movement, and light intensity. Anything that increases the rate of photosynthesis will increase the rate of transpiration, because more stomata open up to let in carbon dioxide. When stomata are open, the rate at which water is lost by evaporation and diffusion increases. Therefore, an increase in light intensity will increase the rate of transpiration.
Conditions that increase the rate of evaporation from the leaf cells and diffusion of water from open stomata will also make transpiration happen more rapidly. Hot, dry, windy conditions increase the rate of transpiration because more water evaporates from the cells and diffusion happens quicker, Water vapour diffuses more rapidly into dry air than into humid air because the concentration gradient is steeper. Windy conditions both increase the rate of evaporation and also maintain a steep concentration gradient from the inside of the leaf to the outside by removing water vapour as it diffuses out.
Temperature affects the rate of transpiration in several ways.The molecules move faster as the temperature increases, so diffusion occurs more rapidly.The rate of photosynthesis also increases as the temperature goes up, so more stomata will be open fbr gas exchange to take place.
Each of these conditions individually increases the rate of transpiration and, when combined, a plant will lose a lot of water in this way. Many plants have adaptations that help them to photosynthesise as much as possible while losing as little water as possible.
Most leaves have a waxy, waterproof layer (the cuticle) to prevent uncontrolled water loss. In very not environments, the cuticle may be very thick and shiny. Most of the stomata are found on the underside of the leaves. This protects them from the direct light and energy of the Sun.
If plant begins to lose water faster than it is replaced by the roots, it can result in some drastic measures. The whole plant may wilt. Wilting is a protection mechanism against further water loss.The leaves all collapse and hang down.This greatly reduces the surface area available for water loss by evaporation. Stomata close, which stops photosynthesis and risks overheating.
However, this prevents most water loss and any further wilting. The plant will remain wilted until the temperature drops, the sun goes in, or it rains. There are many ways to investigate the effect of different factors on the rate of transpiration in plants. Many of them involve a piece of apparatus known as a potometer.
A potometer can be used to show how the uptake of water by a plant changes in different conditions.This gives you a good idea of the amount of water lost by the plant in transpiration. Almost all of the water taken up by a plant is lost in transpiration, but a small amount is used in the metabolism, for example, in photosynthesis.","Explain how you would measure the transpiration rate of a plant?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Health and disease,"Your health is a state of physical and mental well-being, not just an absence of disease. It is at least partly based on individual perceptions.
A cold or headache that might make you feel ill enough to stay in bed on a school day might be less likely to be a problem if you are on holiday. Communicable (infectious) diseases (e,g., tuberculosis and flu) are caused by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses that can be passed from one person to another. Non-communicable diseases cannot be transmitted from one person to another (e.g., heart disease and arthritis). Both communicable and non-communicable diseases are major causes of ill health, but other factors can also affect health. Here are three examples: Diet — if you do not get enough to eat, or the right nutrients, you may suffer from diseases ranging from starvation to anemia or rickets. Too much food, or the wrong type of food, can lead to problems such as obesity, some cancers, or type 2 diabetes, Stress — a certain level of stress is inevitable in everyone’s life and is probably needed for our bodies to function properly. However, scientists are increasingly linking too much stress to an increased risk of developing a wide range of health problems. These include heart disease, certain cancers, and mental health problems, the part of the world you where you live , your gender, your ethnic group and how many children you have. People often have little or no control over their life situation, especially as children or young people. Yet such factors have a big effect on health and well-being and are responsible for many causes of ill health around the world.These include communicable diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases and malaria, through to non-communicable diseases such as heart disease and cancer. . It is important to remember that in the real world, different diseases and health conditions happen at the same time.They interact and often one problem makes another worse. Here are a number of examples — you will learn more about the details of many of these conditions in later chapters.  Viruses living in cells can trigger changes that lead to cancers — for example, the human papilloma virus can cause cervical cancer. The immune system of your body helps you destroy pathogens and get better. If there are defects in your immune system, it may not work effectively. This may be a result of your genetic makeup, poor nutrition, or infections such as HIV/AIDS.This means you will be more likely to suffer from other communicable diseases .  Immune reactions initially caused by a pathogen, even something like the common cold, can trigger allergies to factors in the environment These allergies may cause skin rashes, hives, or asthma.  Physical and mental health are often closely linked. Severe physical ill health can lead to depression and other mental illness.  Malnutrition is often linked to health problems including deficiency diseases, a weakened immune system, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The interaction between different factors, including lifestyle, environment, and pathogens, is an important principle to remember as you look at different types of disease.

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Pathogens and disease,"Communicable diseases, also known as infectious diseases, are found all over the world. Microorganisms that cause disease are called pathogens. Pathogens may be bacteria, viruses, protists, or fungi, and they infect animals and plants, causing a wide range of diseases.
Communicable diseases are caused either directly by a pathogen or by a toxin made by a pathogen. The pathogen can be passed from one infected individual to another individual who does not have the disease. Some communicable diseases are fairly mild, such as the common cold and tonsillitis. Others are known killers, such as tetanus, influenza, and HIV/AIDS.
Sometimes communicable diseases can be passed between different species of oorganisms, For example. Infected animals such as dogs or bats can pass rabies on to people. Tuberculosis can be passed from badgers to cows, and from cows to people. Bacteria and viru5es cause the majority of communicable diseases in people. In plants, viruses and fungi are the most common pathogens. Bacteria are single-celled living organisms that are much smaller than animal and plant cells. Bacteria are used to make food such as yogurt and cheese, to treat sewage, and to make medicines. Bacteria are important both in the environment, as decomposers, and in your body. Scientists estimate that most people have between 1 and 2 kg of bacteria in their guts, and they are rapidly discovering that these bacteria have a major effect on our health and well-being,
Pathogenic bacteria are the minority — but they a e significant because of the major effects they can have on individuals and society.
Viruses are even smaller than bacteria. They usually have regular shapes. Viruses cause diseases in every type of living organism. Once bacteria and viruses are inside your body, they may reproduce rapidly, Bacteria divide rapidly by splitting in two (called binary fission).They may produce toxins (poisons) that affect your body and make you feel ill. Sometimes they directly damage your Cells.  Viruses take over the cells of your body. They five and reproduce inside the ceIIs. damaging and destroying them. Common disease symptoms are a high temperature, headaches, and rashes. These are caused by the way your body responds to the cell damage and toxins produced by the pathogens. The more pathogens that get into your body, the more likely it is that you will develop an infectious disease.There are a number of ways in which pathogens spread from one individual to another. 	By air (including droplet infection). Many pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and fungal spores (that cause plant diseases) are carried and spread from one organism to another in the air. In human diseases, droplet infection is common.When you are ill, you expel tiny droplets full of pathogens from your breathing system when you cough, sneeze, or talk (Figure 2). Other people breathe in the droplets, along with the pathogens they contain, so they pick up the infection. Examples include flu (influenza), tuberculosis, and the common cold. Direct contact. Some diseases are spread by direct contact of an infected organism with a healthy one.This is common in plant diseases, where a tiny piece of infected plant material left in a held can infect an entire new crop. In people, diseases including sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and chlamydia, are spread by direct contact of the skin. Pathogens such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis enter the body through direct sexual contact, cuts, scratches, and needle punctures that give access to the blood. Animals can act as vectors of both plant and animal diseases by carrying a pathogen between infected and uninfected individuals. By water. Fungal spores carried in splashes of water often spread plant diseases. For humans, eating raw, undercooked, or
contaminated food, or drinking water containing sewage can spread diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases, cholera, or salmoneIIosis.The pathogen enters your body through your digestive system. Lifestyle factors often affect the spread of disease. For example, when people live in crowded conditions with no Sewage system, infectious diseases can spread very rapidly.","What causes infectious diseases?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,growing Bacteria in the lab,"To find out more about microorganisms, scientists need to culture them. This means they are grown in very large numbers so that scientists can see all of the bacteria (the colony) as a whole. Scientists can find out what nutrients they need to grow and investigate which chemicals are best at killing them. Bacteria are the most commonly cultured microorganisms. They divide rapidly and easily by simple cell division (binary fission). To culture (grow) microorganisms, you must provide them with everything they need.This means giving them a liquid or gel containing nutrients— a culture medium.This contains carbohydrate as an energy source, various minerals, a nitrogen source so they can make proteins, and sometimes other chemicals. Most microorganisms also need warmth and oxygen to grow.
Hot agar gel is poured into a Petri dish. It is then left to cool and set, before you add the microorganisms. You can also culture microorganisms in a flask of sterile nutrient broth solution.
You need uncontaminated cultures of microorganisms to investigate the effects of chemicals such as disinfectants and antibiotics Contamination can come from your skin, the air, the soil. or the water around you.It is important to avoid any unnecessary contamination. You must take great care when you are culturing microorganisms. The bacteria you want to grow may be harmless. However, there is always the risk that a mutation (a change in the DNA) will take place and produce a new and dangerous pathogen. In school and college laboratories, the maximum temperature at which cultures are incubated is 25°C. You are surrounded by disease-causing bacteria all the time. If you cultured bacteria at 37°C (human body temperature), there would be a high risk of growing some dangerous pathogens. If you use a lower temperature, you reduce the likelihood of growing pathogens that might be harmful to people. In industrial conditions, bacterial cultures are often grown at higher temperatures to enable the microorganisms to grow more rapidly — for example,
insulin-producing genetically modified (GM) bacteria. A hospital lab also incubates human pathogens at 37°C, so that they grow as fast as possible and are identified sooner.","Why do scientists culture microorganisms in the laboratory?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Preventing bacteria growth,"Bacteria reproduce by simple binary fission - they split in two. If bacteria have the right conditions, including enough nutrients and a suitable temperature, they can grow very fast, dividing every 20 minutes. The growth rate of a bacteria population is affected by many different
factors including temperature, available nutrients, oxygen levels, and pH. Changing any of these factors can affect the growth rate of a population.
You can calculate the number of bacteria in a population after a given time as long as you know the mean division time.this varies greatly, from 15—20 minutes to hours, days, or even years For example, if you have one bacterium with a mean division time of 20 minutes, in 24 hours you would have 4722 3664B2869645 213696 (4.7 x 1& , to 2 significant figures) bacteria. If the mean division time is 24 hour5, you would have just 2 ! There are a number of ways to prevent the growth of bacteria. One way
is to raise or lower the temperature. Also, chemicals can be used to stop them growing or to kill them. Disinfectants are chemicals used to kill bacteria in the environment around us. An antiseptic is a disinfectant that is safe to use on human skin. Antibiotics are chemicals that can be used inside our bodies, which kill bacteria or prevent them from growing. You can investigate the effectiveness of temperature changes or chemicals at preventing the growth of bacteria. In each case you need a way of working out how many bacteria have grown.","Describe the difference between a disinfectant and an antiseptic ?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Preventing infections,"People have recognized the symptoms of disease for many centuries. There are records of illnesses people recognize today from the ancient Egyptian’s and ancient Greeks. However, it is only in the past 150—200 years that people have really understood the causes of these diseases and how they are spread. Their work enabled people to prevent the spread of pathogens, and in some cases cure the diseases they cause. Semmelweis was a doctor in the mid-1850s. At the time, many women in hospital died from childbed fever a few days after giving birth. However, no one knew what Caused it.
Semmelweis noticed that his medical students went straight I om dissecting a dead body to delivering a baby without washing their hands. The women delivered by medical Students and doctors rather than midwives were much more likely to die, Semmelweis wondered if they were carrying the cause of disease from the corpses to their patients.
He noticed that another doctor died from symptoms identical to childbed fever after cutting himself while working on a body. This convinced Semmelweis that the fever was caused by some find of infectious agent. He therefore insisted that his medical students wash their hands before delivering babies. Immediately, fewer mothers died from the fever.
However, other doctors were very resistant to Semmelweis’s ideas. There are a number of Keyways to heIp prevent the spread of communicable diseases between people, between animals and people, and between plants. Simple hygiene measures are one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of ppathogens. These include: Hand washing, Using disinfectants on kitchen work surfaces, toilets, etc. to reduce the number of pathogens, Keeping raw meat away from food that is eaten uncooked to prevent the spread of pathogens, Coughing or sneezing into a handkerchief, tissue, or your hands (and then washing your hands). If someone has an infectious disease, especially a serious disease such as Ebola or cholera. they need to be kept in isolation. The fewer healthy
people who come into contact with the infected person, the less likely it is that the pathogens will be passed on.This is also true of plants infected with diseases but it is only possible with Smaller plants that can be moved and destroyed easily. Some communicable diseases are passed on by vectors For example, mosquitoes carry a range of diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever. Houseflies can carry over TOO human diseases, while rats also act as vectors of disease. Aphids transmit over 150 different plant diseases
and different types of beetle carry disease to plants in the form of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. If the vectors are destroyed, the spread of the disease can be prevented. By controlling the number of vectors, the spread of disease can be greatly reduced. During vaccination, doctors introduce a small amount of harmless form of a specific pathogen into your body, As a result if you come into contact with the live pathogen, you will not become ill as your immune system will e prepared. Vaccination is a very successful way of protecting large numbers of humans and animals against serious diseases. However, it cannot protect plants against disease as they do not have an immune System. ","Give an example of things people can do to reduce the spread of pathogens to lower the risk of disease ?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Viral diseases,"Viruses can infect and damage all types of cells The diseases they cause can be mild or potentially deadly. Scientists have not developed medicines to cure viral diseases, so it is important to stop them spreading. In people, viral diseases often start relatively suddenly. The symptoms are the result of the way the body reacts to the viruses damaging and destroying cells as they reproduce. See below for examples of viral diseases. The main Symptoms of measles a e a fever and a red skin rash. The virus is spread by the inhalation of droplets from coughs and sneezes and is very infectious. Measles is a serious disease that can cause blindness and brain damage and may be fatal if complication s arise. In 2013, 145700 people globally died of measles. There is no treatment for measles, so if someone becomes infected they need to be isolated to stop the spread often virus. Measles is now rare in the UK as a result of improved living conditions and a vaccination programme for young children.The challenge now is to vaccinate children globally and make deaths from measles a thing of the past. Around 35 million people globally are infected with HIV, a virus that can eventually lead to AIDS. I n 2013, around 1.5 million people died of HIV related illnesses, Many people do not realise they are infected with
HIV, because the virus only Causes a mild, flu-like illness to begin with. HIV attacks the immune cells and after the initial mild illness it remains hidden inside the immune system, sometimes for years, until the immune system is so badly damaged that it can no longer deal with infections or certain cancers. At this point the patient has developed AIDS. The time between infection with HIV and the onset of the final stages of AIDS is affected by many factors. These include the level of nutrition and overall health of the person, as well as access to antiretroviral drugs. HIV is spread by direct sexual contact and the exchange of body fluids such as blood, which occurs when drug users share needles or when unscreened blood is used for transfusions. HIV can also be passed from mother to child in breast milk.
There is no cure for HIV/AIDS and no vaccine against it.The spread of the disease can be prevented by using condoms, not sharing needles, screening blood used for transfusions, and HIV-positive mothers bottle- feeding their children.
The regular use of antiretroviral drugs can prevent the development of AIDS for many years and give HIV positive people an almost normal life expectancy. Unfortunately, the majority of people infected with HlV live in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa where it is hard to get antiretroviral drugs In these areas the life expectancy for people with HIV/AIDs is still very low. To have the best chance of long-term survival, antiretroviral drugs must be started as soon as possible after infection. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was the first virus ever to be isolated. It is a widespread plant pathogen that affects around 150 species of plants including tomatoes and tobacco plants. It causes a distinctive ‘mosaic’ pattern of discoloration on the leaves as the virus destroys the cells.This affects the growth of the plant because the affected areas of the leaf do not photosynthesise.TMV can seriously reduce the yield of a crop. It is spread by contact between diseased plant material and healthy plants, and insects can act as vectors.The virus can remain infectious in the soil for about 50 years.There is no treatment and farmers now grow TMV-resistant strains of many crop plants. Good field hygiene and good pest control can help prevent the spread of TMV.","Describe the main symptoms of measles ?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Bacterial diseases,"Bacterial diseases affect animals and plants. In the early 20th century, more than 30st of all deaths in the USA were due to infectious diseases. That is now an order of magnitude lower , and most of the infectious diseases that cause death are viral. Improved living standards and vaccinations have had a major effect on the incidence and death rate of Communicable diseases in countries such as the USA and UK.
The development of antibiotics is the other key factor in combating bacterial diseases. Antibiotics kill bacteria or stop them growing and cure bacterial diseases. Unfortunately, bacteria are becoming resistant to many antibiotics and more people are dying from bacterial diseases again. Salmonello are bacteria that live in the guts of many different animals. They can be found in raw meat, poultry, eggs, and egg products such as mayonnaise. If these bacteria get into our bodies, they disrupt the balance of the natural gut bacteria and can cause Salmond/la food
poisoning. One common cause of infection is eating undercooked food, when the bacteria have not been killed by heating, Another is, eating food prepared in unhygienic conditions where food is contaminated with Salmonella bacteria from raw meat.
The symptoms develop within 8—72 hours of eating infected food. Fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea are caused by the bacteria and the toxins they secrete, For many people Salmonella infections
are unpleasant but don‘t last many days and no antibiotics are given, In very young children and the elderly it can be fatal, usually because of dehydration. In countries where there is malnutrition, Salmonella is more serious. The World Health Organization estimates that globally
around 2.2 million people, mainly children under 5 years old, are killed by sickness and diarrhoea each year, including Salmonella food poisoning.
In the UK, poultry are vaccinated against Salmonella to control the spread of the disease. Campylobocier, another bacterium found in chickens, still causes around 280000 cases of food poisoning each year To prevent food poisoning, keep raw chicken away from food that is eaten uncooked, avoid washing raw Chicken (it sprays bacteria around the kitchen), wash hands and surfaces well after handling raw chicken, and cook chicken thoroughly. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD), which are are known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). lt is spread by
unprotected sexual Contact with an infected person. Like many STDs, gonorrhea  has  symptoms in the early stages but then becomes relatively symptomIess. The early symptoms include a thick yellow or green discharge from the vagina or penis and pain on urination, However, about 10% of infected men and 50% of infected women pet no symptoms at all. Untreated gonorrhoea can cause long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies. Babies born to infected mothers may have severe eye infections and even become blind.
Gonorrhoea is bacterial, so it can be treated with antibiotics. Originally it was easily cured using penicillin but now many antibiotic-resistant strains of gonorrhoea have evolved so it is increasingly difficult to treat. All sexual partners of an infected individual must be treated with antibiotics to prevent the disease spreading in the community.The spread of gonorrhoea can also be prevented by using a barrier method of contraception such as a condom and by reducing the number of sexual partners. There are relatively few bacterial diseases of plants and these diseases
are usually found in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacterium that causes crown galls — a mass of unspecialised cells that often grow at the join between the root and the shoot in infected plants . It infects many different plant types including fruit trees, vegetables, and garden flowering plants. The bacteria insert plasmids into the plant cells and cause a mass of new undifferentiated genetically modified cells to grow. For this reason, these bacteria have become a key tool for scientists when genetically modifying plant cells Scientists make use of the way the bacteria naturally infect plant cells and give them new added genes.They manipulate the bacteria so they carry desirable genes into the cells they infect.","Name one way that antibiotics work to cure bacterial infections?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Diseases caused by fungi and protists,"Fungi and protists are less well known than bacteria and viruses but they are also important pathogens. Some of the diseases they cause are of great significance, both in terms of global economies and of human suffering. There are relatively few fungal diseases that affect people. Athlete's foot is a well-known, relatively minor fungal skin condition. A small number of human fungal diseases Can be fatal when they attack the lungs or brains of people who are already ill. Damaged heart valves can also develop serious fungal infections. However, these Conditions are rare. Antifungal drugs are usually effective against skin fungi like athlete’s foot, but it can be hard to treat deep-seated tissue infections.
In plants, however, fungal diseases are common and can be devastating. Huge areas of crops, from cereals to bananas are lost every year as a result of fungal infections, including stem rusts and various rotting diseases. Rose black spot is a fungal disease of rose leaves. It causes purple or black spots to develop on the leaves and it is a nuisance in gardens and for commercial flower growers. The leaves often turn yellow and drop early. This weakens the plant because it reduces the area of leaves available for photosynthesis. As a result the plant does not flower well — and the main reason people grow roses is for the lovely flowers.
The spores of the fungus are spread in the environment, carried by the wind. They are then spread over the plant after it rains in drips of water that splash from one leaf or plant to another. The spores stay dormant over winter on dead leaves and on the stems of rose plants. Gardeners try to prevent the spread by removing and burning affected leaves and stems Chemical fungicides can also help to treat the disease and prevent it spreading. Horticulturists have bred types of roses that are relatively resistant to black spot but the disease still cannot be prevented or cured. Protists (a type of single-celled organism) cause a range of diseases in animals and plants.They are relatively rare patnogens but the diseases they cause are often serious and damaging to tho3e infected. Diseases caused by protists usually involve a vector that transfers the protist to the host One of the best known and globally serious protist diseases is malaria. Malaria is a disease caused by protist pathogens that are parasites — they live and feed on other living organisms.The life cycle of the protists includes time in the human body and time in the body of a female Anopheles mosquito. The protists reproduce sexually in the mosquito and asexually in the human body.The mosquitoes act as vectors of the disease.The female mosquito needs two meals of human blood before she can lay her eggs, and this is when the protists are passed into the human bloodstream.The protists travel around the human body in the circulatory system.They affect the liver and damage led blood cells. Malaria causes recurrent episodes
of fever and shaking when the protists burst out of the blood cells, and it can be fatal. It weakens the affected person over time even if it does not kill them. Globally several hundred million cases of malaria occur each year, and around 660000 people die from the disease. If malaria is diagnosed quickly, it can be treated using a combination of drugs, but this is not always available in the countries most affected by malaria.The protists have also become resistant to some of the most commonly used medicines.The spread of malaria can be controlled in a number of ways, most of which target the mosquito vector. These include:   Using insecticide-impregnated insect nets to prevent mosquitoes biting humans and passing on the protists , Using insecticides to kill mosquitoes in homes and offices, Preventing the vectors from breeding by removing standing water and spraying water with insecticides to kill the larvae and travelers can take antimalarial drugs that kill the parasites in the blood if they are bitten by an infected mosquito.","Describe three was which fungal diseases such as black spot or stem rust can be spread from plant to plant?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Human defence responses,"The mucus produced from your nose turns green when you have a cold. Why does this happen? It is all part of the way your body defends itself against disease. Each day, you meet millions of disease-causing microorganisms. Every body opening as well as any breaks in the skin give pathogens a way in. The more pathogens that get Into your body, the more likely it is that you will get an infectious disease, FortunateIy, your body has many defense mechanisms that work together to keep the pathogens out.  Your skin covers your body and acts as a barrier. It prevents bacteria and viruses reaching the tissues beneath. If you damage or cut your skin, the barrier is broken but your body restores it.You bleed, and the platelets in your blood set up a chain of events to form a clot that dries into a scab . This forms a seal over the cut, stopping pathogens getting in. It also stops you bleeding to death. Your skin produces antimicrobial secretions to destroy pathogenic
bacteria. Healthy Skin is cove ed with microorganisms that help keep you healthy and act as an extra barrier to the entry of pathogens. Your respiratory system is a weak link in your body defenses. Every time you breathe in, you draw air full of pathogens into the airways or the lungs. In the same way, you take food and drink, as well as air, into your digestive system through your mouth. Both Systems have good defenses to help prevent pathogens constantly causing infections. Your nose is full of hairs and produces a sticky liquid, called mucus.
The hairs and mucus trap particles in the air that may contain pathogens or irritate your lungs. If you spend time in an environment with lots of air pollution, the mucus you produce when you blow your nose is blackened, showing that the system works. The trachea and bronchi also secrete mucus that traps pathogens from the air. The lining of the tubes is Covered in cilia — tiny hair-like projections from the cells. The cilia beat to waft the mucus up to the back of the throat where it is swallowed. The stomach produces acid and this destroys the microorganisms in the mucus you swallow, as well as the majority often pathogens you take in through your mouth in your food and drink. In spite of your body’s defence mechanisms, some pathogens still get inside your body. Once there, they will meet your second line of defence — the white blood cells of your immune system.The immune system will try to destroy any pathogens that enter the body in several ways. Ingesting microorganisms, some white blood cells ingest (take in) pathogens, digescinp and destroying them so they cannot make you ill. Producing antibodies, Some white blood cells produce special chemicals called antibodies. These target particular bacteria or viruses and destroy them. You need a unique antibody for each type of pathogen.When your white blood cells have produced antibodies once against a particular pathogen, they can be made very quickly if that pathogen gets into the body again.This stops you getting the disease twice. Producing antitoxins, Some white blood cells produce antitoxins. These counteract the toxins released by the pathogens. The different body systems work together to help protect you from disease. For example, some white blood cells contain green-coloured enzymes. These white blood cells destroy the cold viruses and any bacteria trapped in the mucus of your nose when you have a Cold.
The dead white blood cells, along with the dead bacteria and viruses, are removed in the mucus, making it leak green. ","Describe how washing your hands can prevent the spread of disease?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,more about plant diseases,"The global loss of food crops to plant pathogens is 15-40% a year. Understanding the causes and preventing the spread of plant diseases can help provide a secure food supply for everyone. As you have seen, plants are vulnerable to viruses, bacteria, and fungi but they are also attacked by nests that cause a lot of damage. Insect pests may both destroy plants directly and act as vectors of disease. One important group of insect plant pests is the aphids. Aphids have sharp mouthparts that penetrate into the phloem vessels of the plant 5o they can feed on the sugar-rich phloem sap. Aphids attack in huge
numbers, depriving the plant cells of the products of photosynthesis. This can seriously damage and weaken the plant, Aphids also act as vectors, transferring viruses, bacteria, and fungi from diseased plants into the tissues of healthy plants on their mouthpafts. Aphids can be destroyed using chemical pesticides or, in enclosed spaces
such as greenhouses, using biological pest control. Releasing  aphid- eating insects such as ladybirds and their larvae can control the pathogen population so it does not have an impact on the success of the crop.
Other plant pests, including tiny nematode worms and many insect larvae that live in the soil, feed in or on plant roots, damaging them so they cannot absorb water and mineral ions effectively. As a result the plant fails to grow and thrive. Some plant diseases are the result of mineral deficiencies in the soil where the plants are growing. They are non-Communicable — they are not passed from one plant to another. For example, plants need a
food supply of nitrate ions from the soil to convert the sugars made in photosynthesis into proteins needed for growth in protein synthesis.
If there is a nitrate deficiency in the soil, protein growth will be limited, the growth of plants will be stunted, and they will not produce a crop properly.
Plants take magnesium ions from the soil to make the chlorophyll needed for photosynthesis. If the level of magnesium ions in the soil is low, the plant cannot make enough chlorophyll. The leaves become yellow and growth slows down because the plant cannot photosynthesise fully.The yellowing of the leaves due to lack of magnesium ions is known as chlorosis.
If the missing mineral ions are replaced using fertilisers fairly quickly, the damage can be repaired and the plant recovers. If not it will eventually die.","Describe the effect of a lack of nitrate ions in the soil on the growth of a plant?

Disease and bioenergetics,Communicable diseases,Plant defence responses,"You are familiar with some of the way5 the human body defends itself against the entry of pathogens. Plants have also evolved some very effective defences against the attacks of microorganisms, insects, and even larger herbivores. Plants have evolved both physical and Chemical defences against pathogenic microorganisms. Plants have a number of physical barriers that reduce the invasion of pathogens:  The cellulose cell walls mat strengthen plant Cells also help to resist invasion by microorganisms. This is one reason why the actions of aphids that pierce the cellulose Cell walls are so damaging. It breaches the barrier and gives pathogens a way into the Cells, the tough waxy cuticle on the surface of leaves acts as a barrier to the entry of pathogens. It is only at the stomata that pathogens actuality have access to the Cells within the leaf, bark on trees, and a layer of dead Cells on the outside of stems, form a protective layer that is nard for pathogens to penetrate. When the dead cells are lost or shed, the pathogens fall off with them and Leaf fall — deciduous trees lose their leaves in autumn Any pathogens that infect the leaves, such as rose black spot, fall off the tree when the leaves are lost. Many plants produce antibacterial chemicals that protect them against invading pathogens, and these are very effective at preventing bacterial diseases in many plants. Until recently people have not extracted and used plant chemicals as antibiotics. As current antibiotics become Ies3 effective, scientists are increasingly investigating plant antibacterial chemicals to see if they can be adapted for use as antibiotics against human pathogens.
Mint and witch hazel are often used as mild antiseptic’s in cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines. Compounds from plants including pines, cypress, and euphorbias also have promising antibiotic properties. Plants don’t just defend themselves against microorganisms. They also defend themselves against the large and small animals that want to eat them. Obviously if a plant is eaten by a large herbivore it is destroyed and will not flower and reproduce. If smaller herbivores such as aphids,
cate pillars, or beetles attack a plant, they Can damage the plants and act as vectors of pathogens themselves. Not only that, the damage they do may allow other disease-causing organisms to get in. Some of these defences are chemical and others are mechanical. ","Give an example of how a plant may defend itself against pathogens?

Disease and bioenergetics,Preventing and treating disease,Vaccination,"Every cell has unique proteins on its surface called antigens. The antigens on the microorganisms that get into your body are different to the ones on your own cells. Your immune system recognises that they are different.
Your white blood cells then make specific antibodies, which join up with the antigens and inactivate or destroy that particular pathogen.
Some of your white blood cells (the memory cells) 'remember ‘the right antibody needed to destroy a particular pathogen. If you meet that pathogen again, these memory Cells Can make the same antibody very quickly to kill the pathogen, so you become immune to the disease.
The first time you meet a new pathogen you pet ill because there is a delay while your body sorts out the right antibody needed. The next time, your immune system destroys the invaders before they can make you feel unwell. Some pathogens, such as meningitis, can make you seriously ill very quickly. In fact, you Can die before your body manages to make the right antibodies. Fortunately, you Can be protected against many of these serious diseases by vaccination (also known as immunisation).
Immunisation involves giving you a vaccine made of a dead or inactivated form of a disease-causing microorganism. It stimulates your body’s natural immune response to invading pathogens.
A small amount of dead or inactive forms of a pathogen is introduced into your body. This stimulates the white blood cells to produce the antibodies needed to fight the pathogen and prevent you from getting ill.Then, if you meet the same, live pathogen, your white blood Cells can respond rapidly. They can make the right antibodies just as if you had already had the disease, so that you are protected against it.
Doctors use vaccines to protect us both against bacterial diseases, such as tetanus and diphtheria, and viral diseases such as polio, measles and mumps. For example, the MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumDs, and rubella. Vaccines have saved millions of lives around the world. One disea5e — smaIIpox — has been completely wiped out by vaccinations.
Doctors hope polio will also disappear in the next few years. If a large proportion of the population is immune to a
disease, the spread of the pathogen in the population is very much reduced and the disease may even disappear. This is known as herd immunity. If, for any reason, the number of people taking up a vaccine falls, the herd immunity is lost and the disease can reappear. This is what happened in the UK in the 1970s when there was a scare about the safety of the whooping cough vaccine. In the following years, thousands of children got whooping cough again and a substantial number died. Yet the vaccine was as safe as any medicine.
Eventually people realized this and enough children were vaccinated for herd immunity to be effective again.There are global vaccination programmes to control a number of diseases, including tetanus in mothers and new-born babies, polio, and measles.The World Health
Organisation want 95% of children to have two doses of measles vaccine to give global herd immunity. Current global figures snow that  85% of children get the first dose and 56% get the second. It will take money and determination to get global herd immunity against a range of different
diseases, but the advantages both to individuals and to global economies are huge.","Describe what an antigen is ?

Disease and bioenergetics,Preventing and treating disease,Antibiotics and painkillers,"When you have an infectious disease, you generally take medicines that contain useful drugs. Often the medicine doesn’t affect the pathogen that is causing the problems — it just eases the symptoms and makes you feel better. Drugs such as aspirin and paracetamol are very useful painkillers. When you have a cold, they will help relieve your headache and sore throat. On the owner hand, they will have no effect on me viruses that have entered your tissues and made you feel ill.
Many of the medicines you can buy at a chemises or supermarket relieve your symptoms but do not bill the pathogens, so they do not cure you any faster. You have to wait for your immune system to overcome the pathogens before you actually gel well again. Drugs that make you feel better are useful, but in some cases what you really need are drugs that can care you, You Can use antiseptics and disinfectants to kill bacteria outside the body, but they are far too poisonous to use inside your body. They would kill you and your pathogens at the same time,
The drugs that have really changed the treatment of communicable diseases are antibiotics. These a e medicines that can work inside your body to kill bacterial pathogens. The impact of antibiotics on deaths from communicable diseases has been enormous. Antibiotics first became widely available in the 1940s. They were regarded as wonder drugs. For example, the number of women who died of infections in the first days after giving birth dropped dramatically. Antibiotics, such as penicillin, work by killing the bacteria that cause disease whilst they are inside your body. They damage the bacterial cells without harming your own cells. Bacterial diseases that killed millions of people in the past can now be cured using antibiotics. They have had an enormous effect on our society.
If you need antibiotics, you usually take a pill or syrup, but if you are very ill antibiotics may be put straight into your bloodstream. This makes sure that they reach the pathogens in your cells as quickly as possible. Some antibiotics kill a wide range of bacteria. Others are very specific and only work against particular bacteria. It is important that the right antibiotic
is chosen and used. Specific bacteria should be treated with the specific antibiotic that is effective against them. Unfortunately, antibiotics are not the complete answer to the problem of infectious diseases:  Antibiotics cannot kill viral pathogens so they have no effect on diseases caused by viruses. Viruses reproduce inside the cells of your body. It is extremely difficult to develop drugs that will kill the viruses without damaging the cells and tissues of your body at the same time and strains of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics are evolving, This means that antibiotics which used to kill a particular type of bacteria no longer have an effect, so they cannot cure the disease. There are some types of bacteria that are resistant to all known antibiotics. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria is a matter of great concern. Unless scientists can discover new antibiotics soon, we may no longer be able to cure bacterial diseases. This means that many millions of people in the future will die of bacterial diseases that we can currently cure.  ","What do antibiotics do?

Disease and bioenergetics,Preventing and treating disease,Discovering and developing drugs,"Traditionally drugs were extracted from plants of microorganisms such as moulds. In ancient Egypt mouldy bread was used on septic wounds, perhaps an early form of antibiotic treatment. Now scientists often adapt chemicals from microorganisms, plants, and animals to make more effective drugs. There a e a number of drugs used today that are based on traditional medicines extracted from plants.
Digitalis is one of several drugs extracted from foxgloves, and the drug digoxin is another. They nave been used since the 18th century to help strengthen the heartbeat. There are many more modern drugs but doctors still use digoxin, especially for older patients with heart problems. Large amounts of these chemicals can act as poisons.
The painkiller aspirin originates f om a compound found in the bark of willow trees. The anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties were first recorded in 400BC. In 1897, Felix Hoffman synthesized acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin), which not only relieves pain and inflammation better than willow bark but has fewer side effects, Aspirin is still commonly used to treat a wide range of health problems. In the early 20th century, scientists were looking for chemicals that might kill bacteria and cure infectious diseases. In 1928, Alexander Fleming was growing bacteria for study purposes. He was rathe careless, often leaving the lids off his culture plates — health and safety procedures were not as good in those days.
After one holiday, Fleming saw that lots of his culture plates had mould growing on them. He noticed a clear ring in the jelly around some of me spots of mould and realized something and killed the bacteria covering the gel. Fleming recognised the importance of his observations. He called the substance that killed bacteria ‘penicillin’ after the Penicillium mould that produced it. He tried unsuccessfully for several years to extract an active juice from the mould before giving up and moving on to other work.
About 10 years after Fleming’s discovery, Ernst Chain and Howard Florey set about trying to extract penicillin, and they succeeded. They gave some penicillin to a man dying of a blood infection and he recovered almost miraculously — until the penicillin ran out. Even though their patient
died, Florey and Chain demonstrated that penicillin could cure bacterial infections in people. Eventually, working with the company Pfizer in the USA, Florey and Chain made penicillin on an industrial scale, producing enough to supply the demands of World War II. It is still used today. There is a continuing drive to find new medicines but it is difficult.
For example, it is not easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria without damaging human cells. Most drugs are now synthesised by research chemists working in the pharmaceutical industry using chemical banks and computer models. However, the starting point may still be a chemical extracted from a plant or microorganism. Compounds showing promise as antibiotics can be modified to produce more powerful molecules that can be synthesised easily and cheaply.
For example, the noni fruit is widely used in traditional medicine in Costa Rica and many other countries to treat both infections and non-communicable diseases, People have also used it for food and drink for centuries with no apparent problems. Recent research shows that it has antibiotic properties More research is taking place to see if this traditional healing plant might be the source of new antibiotics or other medicines. Scientists are also collecting soil samples globally and searching for microorganisms to produce a new antibiotic against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Only about J96 of soil microorganisms can be cultured in the lab. Scientists have developed a special unit that enables them to grow microorganisms in the soil in a controlled way. Using this technology, in
2015 they announced a completely new type of antibiotic from some soil bacteria. In tests so far, this antibiotic has destroyed all bacteria including MRSA and other antibiotic resistant pathogens. It worked in mice — will it work in humans ? New medicines are being developed all the time, as scientists and doctors try to find ways of curing more diseases. Scientists test new medicines in the laboratory. Every new medical treatment has to be extensively tested
and trialled in a series of stages before it is used. This process makes sure
that it works well and is as safe as possible. A good medicine is:  Effective — it must prevent or cure a disease or at least make you feel better, safe — the drug must not be too toxic (poisonous) or have unacceptable side effects for me patient, Stable — you must be able to use the medicine under normal conditions and store it for some time and Successfully taken into and removed f om your body — it must reach its target and be cleared from your system once it has done its work. When scientists research a new medicine they have to make sure all these Conditions are met. It Can take up to 12 years to bring a new medicine into your doctor’s surgery and costs around £1700 million, including failures and capital costs.
Researchers target a disease and make lots of possible new drugs. These are tested in the laboratory to find out if they are toxic (toxicity) and if they seem to do their job (efficacy). In the laboratory they are tested on cells, tissues, and even whole organs.  Many Chemicals fail at this stage.
The small numbers of chemicals, which pass the earlier tests, are then laboratory tested on animals, to Nina out how they work in a whole living organism. It also gives information about possible doses and side effects. The tissues and animals are used as models to predict now the drugs may behave in humans.
Up to this point the Chemicals are undergoing preclinical testing. This always takes place in the laborat ory using cells, tissues, and live animals,
Drugs that pass animal testing move on to clinical trials. Clinical trials use healthy volunteers and patients. First, very low doses are given to healthy people to check for side effects. \l the drug is found to be safe, it is tried on a small number of patients to see if it treats the disease. If it
seems to be safe and effective, bigger clinical trials take place to find the optimum dose for the drug.
If the medicine passes all the legal tests, it is licenced so your doctor can
prescribe it. Its safety will be monitored for as long as it is used. In human trials, scientists use a double blind trial to see just how effective the new medicine is. A group of patients with the target disease agree
to take part in  the trials. Some are given a placebo that does not contain the drug and some are given the new medicine. Patients are randomly allocated to the different groups. Then neither the doctor nor the patients know who has received the real drug or the placebo until the trial is complete.The patients‘ health is monitored carefully.
Often the placebo will contain a different drug that is already used to treat the disease.This means the patient is not deprived of treatment whilst taking part in the trial.  The results of drug tests and trials, like all scientific research, are published in journals after they have been scrutinised in a process of peer review.
This means other scientists working in the same area can check the results over, helping to prevent false claims National bodies such the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NACE} look at the published results of drugs trials and decide which drugs give good value for money and should be prescribed by the NHS.","Which drugs were traditionally extracted from plants?

Disease and bioenergetics,Preventing and treating disease,making and using monoclonal antibodies,"Imagine combining cells from mice or people and cancer cells to form a new type of cell. Then using those new cells in human and animal medicine and in the diagnosis of plant diseases. This might sound far-fetched or even dangerous. However, scientists and doctors are finding more and more ways of using these unusual cells, known as hybridomas. Monoclonal antibodies, like vaccinations, are a form of medical treatment
that relies on the immune system. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that are produced to target particular cells or chemicals in the body. Some white blood cells known as lymphocytes make antibodies but cannot divide. Tumour Cells do not usually make antibodies, but they can divide rapidly to make a clone of cells.
All mammals, including mice, produce lymphocytes, Scientists combine mice lymphocytes (that have been stimulated to make a particular antibody) with a type of tumour cell to make s cell called a hybridoma. Single hybridoma cells divide to make a large number
of identical cells that all produce the same antibodies. These antibodies a e collected and purified. They are  monoclonal antibodies —antibodies produced from a single clone of cells. More recently scientists have combined the mice cells with human cells as well to produce monoclonal antibodies that are less likely to be rejected by human cells. Antigens are protein molecules that are often found on the surface of cells, although free protein molecules can also act as antigens. The
monoclonal antibodies produced from a single clone of cells are specific to one binding site on one specific antigen.This antigen might be found only on specific types of cell in the body, or it miqht be a specific chemical. Because the monoclonal antibodies only target and bind to one specific antigen, they can then be used in a number of ways. Pregnancy tests — these rely on monoclonal antibodies that bind
to the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
that is made in the early stages of pregnancy.
Tiny amounts of the hormone are passed out of the body in the urine. Monoclonal antibodies in the pregnancy test bind to the hormone if it is present, and this
is used to produce the colour change that signals a positive result. Diagnosis of disease — monoclonal antibodies are made to bind to specific antigens found on pathogens, or on blood clots or on cancer cells. The monoclonal antibodies may also carry markers that make it easy for doctors to see where they have built up. This allows doctors to detect problems before they are seriously affecting a patient’s health. For example, the blood test for prostate cancer uses monoclonal antibodies to bind to prostate-specific antigens Monoclonal antibodies are becoming increasingly Important in the detection of plant, animal, and human diseases. Measuring and monitoring — monoclonal antibodies are used
in hospitals and laboratories to measure or monitor the levels of
hormones and other chemicals in the blood. For example, screening donated blood for HIV infection, detecting drugs that have been used illegally by athletes, and detecting infections such as syphilis. Research — research scientists use monoclonal antibodies to locate or identify specific molecules in a cell or tissue. Scientists produce the monoclonal antibodies linked to a molecule of a fluorescent dye. When the monoclonal antibodies bind to the desired molecules, scientists can see what has happened by observing the build-up of fluorescence. At the beginning of the 2Oth century, Nobel Prize winner Paul Ehrlich was the first scientist to imagine a ’magic bullet‘— a drug precisely targeted at a pathogen or disease. When monoclonal antibodies were first developed in 1975, doctors and scientists thought they had found the magic bullet. Because monoclonal antibodies target a specific type of cell or a specific chemical, scientists and doctors are looking at ways to use them in the treatment of very specific diseases. Many types of cancer are still not easy
to meat, and scientists are working hard to develop treatments using different monoclonal antibodies that will target specific cancers. They
are increasingly successful. Currently there are three different ways of using monoclonal antibodies to treat cancers. Each has produced some cancer treatments that are being used and many more are in clinical trials. They include:  Direct use of monoclonal antibodies to trigger the immune system to recognise, attack, and destroy cancer cells. Using monoclonal antibodies to block receptors on the surface of cancer ceIIs and so stop the cells growing and dividing.  Monoclonal antibodies can be used to carry toxic drugs of radioactive substances for radiation therapy, or chemicals that stop cells g owing and dividing to aback the cancer cells directly, without harming other cells in the body. One of the biggest potential advantages of using monoclonal antibodies is that they only bind to the specific diseased or damaged cells that need treatment. Healthy cells are not affected at all. In contrast, conventional
drug treatment is carried all around the body in the blood and can have a devastating effect on healthy cells as well as, for example, cancer cells. Radiotherapy treatment for Cancer is targeted on the area of the body affected by the tumour but still usually affects the healthy tissue in that area as well. Another advantage is that the specificity of monoclonal antibodies means that they could be used to treat a wide range of conditions. Although at the moment monoclonal antibodies are very expensive to develop, potentially they could become cheaper to develop than conventional drugs, because all the treatments will be based on a tested technology. Monoclonal antibody treatments are not yet as widely used or as successful as everyone hoped when they were first developed almost 40 years ago. Initially they created more side effects than expected. This was partly due to the use of mouse cells only in the formation of the hybridoma cells.The monoclonal antibodies produced were mouse
antibodies, and they triggered an immune response in humans.This held back research. Now developments such as the production of mouse- human hybrid cells and the use of fractions of antibodies to carry drugs to target cells are reducing side effects. Also, doctors are now prepared for side effects and can treat the symptoms. Producing the right monoclonal antibodies and attaching them to drugs and other compounds proved more difficult than expected.The development of more skills and technologies now means monoclonal
antibodies are being used in more and more different ways.They may yet end up as the magic bullets of medicine — or at least as part of the bullet. ","What are some uses of monoclonal antibodies?

Disease and bioenergetics,Non-Communicable diseases,Non-communicable diseases,"Only three of the top J0 killer diseases in the world in 2012 were communicable — lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, HIV/AlDS,and diarrhoeal diseases. The other seven were non-communicable diseases.These are diseases that are not infectious and affect people as a result of their genetic makeup, their Iifestyle, and factors in their environment. There are many risk factors for disease, including the genes you inherit
from your parents and your age, which you cannot change. Risk factors for disease also include:  aspects of your lifestyle such as smoking, lack of exercise, or overeating. Substances that are present in the environment or in your body such as ionising radiation, UV light from the sun, or second-hand tobacco smoke. Certain lifestyle factors, or environmental substances, have been shown to increase your risk of developing particular diseases. Risk factors for non- communicable diseases vary from one disease to another and some may affect more than one disease. Examples of risk  factors for a number of non-communicable diseases include diet, obesity, fitness levels, smoking, drinking alcohol, and exposure to carcinogens in the environment such as ionising radiation. We have the power to influence, change, or remove many of these risk factors. Scientists often see similarities in the patterns between non- communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease or lung cancer with lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise or smoking. These similarities may suggest a link or relationship between the two, known as a correlation. However, a correlation does not prove that one thing is the cause of another (Figure 2).
It is useful to find correlations between lifestyle factors and particular diseases, but this is only the first step. Doctors and scientists then need to do lots of research to discover if there is a causal mechanism. A causal mechanism explains how
one factor influences another through a biological process. If a causal mechanism can be demonstrated, there is a link between the two. For example, there is a clear causal link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer. Anyone can get lung cancer, but smoking increases that risk because you take carcinogens into your lungs. Every serious disease has a human impact on the individual affected and their family. It will often have a
financial cost as well if a wage-earner becomes ill and cannot work. Local communities often bear the cost of supporting people who are ill, whether formally
through taxes or informally by taking care of affected families. Diseases cost nations huge sums of money both in the expense of treating ill people and in the loss of money earned when large numbers of the population are ill. The global economy suffers too, especially when diseases affect younger, working-age populations. Non-communicable diseases affect far more people than communicable diseases, so they have the greatest effect at both human and economic levels.

Disease and bioenergetics,Non-Communicable diseases,Cancer,"Cancer is a disease that affects people in many families. The cells in your body divide on a regular basis in a set sequence known as the cell cycle that involves several stages. A tumour forms when control of this sequence is lost and the cells grow in an abnormal, uncontrolled way. Tumour cells do not respond to the normal mechanisms that control the cell cycle.They divide rapidly with very little non-dividing time for growth in between each division.This results in a mass of abnormally growing cells called a tumour . Some tumours are caused by communicable diseases. For example, the bacteria agrobacterium
tumefaciens can cause Crown galls in plants, and the human papilloma virus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer in humans.
Benign tumours are growths of abnormal cells contained in one place, usually within a membrane.They do not invade other parts of the
body but a benign tumour can grow very large, very quickly. If it causes pressure or damage to an organ, this can be life-threatening. For example, benign tumours on the brain can be very dangerous because there is no extra space for them to grow into,
Malignant tumour cells can spread around the body, invading neighboring healthy tissues. A malignant tumour is often referred to as cancer. The initial tumour may split up, releasing small clumps of cells into the bloodstream or lymphatic system. They Circulate and are carried to different parts of the body where they may lodge in another organ. Then they continue their uncontrolled division and form secondary tumours.
Cancer cells not only divide more rapidly than normal cells, they also live longer. The growing tumour often completely disrupts normal tissues and, if left untreated, will often kill the person. Because of the way malignant tumours spread around the body, it can be very difficult to treat them. Scientists still do not understand what triggers the formation of many cancers, but some of the causes are well known. There are clear genetic risk factors for some cancers including early
breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Most cancers are the result of mutations — changes in the genetic material. Chemicals such as asbestos and the tar found in tobacco smoke can cause mutations that trigger the formation of tumours. These cancer-causing agents are called carcinogens. lonising radiation, such as UV light and X-rays, can also interrupt the normal cell cycle and cause tumours to form. For example, melanomas  appear when there is uncontrolled growth of pigment- forming cells in the skin as a result of exposure to UV light from the sun. About 15% of human cancers are caused by virus infections. For example, cervical cancer is almost always the result of infection by HPV.Teenagers in the UK are now routinely vaccinated against the virus. Because of the way cancer can spread through the body it can be difficult
to treat. In recent years, treatments have become increasingly successful. Scientists are working hard to develop new treatments, and are also finding that combining some older treatments makes them more successful too. The two main ways we can treat cancer at the moment are:  Radiotherapy, when the cancer cells are destroyed by targeted doses of radiation.This stops mitosis in the cancer cells but can also damage healthy cells. Methods of delivering different types of radiation in very targeted ways are improving cure rates. Chemotherapy, where chemicals are used to either stop the cancer cells dividing or to make them’seIf-destruct'. There are many different types of chemotherapy and scientists are working to make them as specific to cancer cells as possible.","What is a tumour?

Disease and bioenergetics,Non-Communicable diseases,Smoking and the risk of disease,"There are around 1.1 billion smokers world-wide, smoking around ó000 billion cigarettes each year, so smoking is big business. Every cigarette smoked contains tobacco leaves which, as they burn, produce around 4000 different chemicals that are inhaled into the throat, trachea, and lungs.
At least 150 of these are linked to disease. Some of these chemicals are absorbed into the bloodstream to be carried around the body to the brain. Nicotine is the addictive, but relatively harmless drug found in tobacco smoke. It produces a sensation of calm, well-being, and ‘being able to cope ‘and this is why people like smoking. Unfortunately, some of the other chemicals in tobacco smoke can cause lasting and often fatal damage to the body cells. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas found in tobacco smoke and it takes up some of the oxygen-carrying capacity of your blood. After smoking a cigarette, up to 10% of the blood will be carrying carbon monoxide rather than oxygen. This can lead to a shortage of oxygen, one reason why many smokers get more breathless when they exercise than non-smokers. Oxygen shortage is a particular problem in pregnant women who smoke. During pregnancy a woman is carrying oxygen for her developing foetus as well as herself. If the mother’s blood is carrying carbon monoxide, the foetus may not get enough oxygen to grow properly. This can lead to premature births, low birthweight babies and even stillbirths, where the baby is born dead. There are around 3500 stillbirths in the UK each year. Scientists estimate that around 20% result from the mother smoking during her pregnancy. In other words, 700 babies a year are born dead due to smoking. The cilia in the trachea and bronchi that move mucus, bacteria, and dirt away from the lungs are anaesthetised by some of the chemicals in tobacco smoke. They stop working for a time, allowing dirt and pathogens down into the lungs and increasing the risk of infections. Mucus also builds up overtime and causes coughing. Other toxic compounds in tobacco smoke include tar. This is a sticky, black chemical that accumulates in the lungs, turning them from pink to grey.
Along with other chemicals in the smoke, tar makes smokers much more likely to develop bronchitis (inflammation and infection of the bronchi). The build-up of tar in the delicate lung tissue can lead to a breakdown in the structure of the alveoli, causing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This reduces the surface area to volume ratio of the lungs, leading to severe breathlessness and eventually death.
Tar is also a carcinogen. It acts on the delicate cells of the lungs and greatly increases the risk of lung cancer developing. Tar also causes other cancers of the breathing system, for example, the throat, larynx, and trachea. The chemicals in tobacco smoke also affect the heart and blood vessels.
Scientists have data showing that smokers are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular problems than non-smokers .They have also worked out the mechanisms that show it is a causal link, not just a correlation.
Smoking narrows the blood vessels in your skin, ageing it. Nicotine makes the heart rate increase whilst other chemicals damage the lining of the arteries. This makes coronary heart disease more likely, and it increases the risk of clot formation. The mixture of chemicals in cigarette smoke also lead to an increase in blood pressure. This combination of effects increases the risk of suffering cardiovascular disease including heart attacks and strokes.

Disease and bioenergetics,Non-Communicable diseases,"Diet, exercise, and disease","The evidence is building that your weight and the amount of exercise you tame affects your risk of developing various diseases. These diseases can be life-changing and even life threatening. If you eat more food than you need, the excess is stored as fat. You need some body fat to cushion your internal organs and act as an energy store. However, over time regularly eating too much food will make you overweight and then obese.
Carrying too much weight is often inconvenient and uncomfortable. Far worse, obesity can lead to serious health problems, such as type 2 diabetes (high blood sugar levels, which are hard to control), high blood pressure, and heart disease. The food you eat transfers energy to your muscles as they work from respiration, so the amount of exercise you do affects the amount of respiration in your muscles, and the amount of food you need. People who exercise regularly are usually much fitter than people who take little exercise. People who take regular exercise make bigger muscles, up to 40% of their body mass, and muscle tissue needs much more energy to be transferred from food than body fat. People who exercise regularly have fitter hearts and bigger lungs than people who don’t exercise.
But exercise doesn't always mean time spent training or ’working out’ in the gym. Walking to school, running around the house looking after small children, or doing a physically active job all count as exercise too.
Between 60 and 75% of your daily food intake is needed for the basic reactions that keep you alive. About 10% is needed to digest your food so only the final 15—30% is affected by your physical activity!
Scientists and doctors have collected lots of evidence that people who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people who do not exercise. They are less likely to suffer from many other health problems too, including type 2 diabetes. Here are some of the causal mechanisms that explain why exercise helps to keep you healthy. You will have more muscle tissue, increasing your metabolic rate, so you are less likely to be overweight. This reduces the risk of developing arthritis, diabetes, and high blood pressure, for example.
Your heart will be fitter and develop a better blood supply. Regular exercise lowers your blood cholesterol levels and helps the balance of the different types of cholesterol. This reduces your risk of fatty deposits building up on your coronary arteries, so lowering your risk of heart disease and other health problems. In type 2 diabetes, either your body doesn’t make enough insulin to control your blood sugar levels or your cells stop responding to insulin. This can lead to problems with circulation, kidney function, and eyesight which may eventually lead to death. Type 2 diabetes gets more common with age and some people have a genetic tendency to develop it. The evidence is now overwhelming that being overweight or obese and not doing much exercise are risk factors for type 2 diabetes at any age. Type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly common in young people. By 3025, an estimated 4 million people in the UK will have diabetes and 9096 of those cases will be type 2. Fortunately, most people can restore their normal blood glucose balance simply by eating a balanced diet with controlled amounts of carbohydrate, losing weight, and doing regular exercise.

Disease and bioenergetics,Non-Communicable diseases,Alcohol and other carcinogens,"There are many different agents that increase your risk of developing
non-communicable diseases. Some of these you may take into your body willingly, and some you may be unaware of. Alcohol (ethanol) is a commonly used social drug in many parts of the world. It is poisonous but the liver can usually remove it before permanent damage or death results. Alcohol is also very addictive. After an alcoholic drink, the ethanol is absorbed into the blood from the put and passes easily into the body tissues, including the brain. It affects the nervous system, making thought processes, reflexes, and many reactions slower than normal. In small amounts alcohol makes people feel relaxed, cheerful, and reduces inhibitions. Larger amounts lead to lack of self-control and lack of judgement. If the dose of alcohol is too high, it can sometimes lead to unconsciousness, coma, and death. People can easily become addicted to alcohol, needing the drug to function, and they may drink heavily for many years. Their liver and brain may suffer long-term damage and eventually the alcohol can kill them: They may develop cirrhosis of the liver, a disease that destroys the liver tissue. The active liver cells are replaced with scar tissue that cannot carry out vital functions. Alcohol is a carcinogen so heavy drinkers are at increased risk of developing liver cancer. This usually spreads rapidly and is difficult to treat. Long term heavy alcohol use also causes damage to the brain. In some alcoholics the brain becomes so soft and pulpy that the normal brain structures are lost and it can no longer function properly. This too can cause death. The damage to the liver and brain associated with heavy drinking usually develops over years, but short bouts of very heavy drinking risk the same symptoms appearing relatively fast, even in young people. If a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it passes across the placenta into the developing baby. Miscarriage, stillbirths, premature births, and low birthweight are all risks linked to drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The developing liver cannot cope with alcohol, so the development of the brain and body of an unborn baby can be badly affected, especially in the early stages of pregnancy. The baby may have facial deformities, problems with its teeth, jaw or hearing, kidney, liver, and heart problems, and may have learning and other developmental problems. This is known as foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Doctors are not sure how much alcohol is safe during pregnancy. The best advice is not to drink at all to avoid foetal alcohol syndrome. The more you drink, the higher the risk to the unborn baby. lonising radiation in the form of different types of electromagnetic waves is a well-known carcinogen (risk factor for cancer). Radioactive materials are a source of ionising radiation. The radiation penetrates the cells and damages the chromosomes, causing mutations in the DNA. The more you are exposed to ionising radiation, the more likely it is that mutations will occur, and that cancer will develop.
Ionising radiation is particularly dangerous when taken directly into your body. For example, breathing radioactive materials into the lungs enables the ionising radiation to penetrate directly into the cells. Well-known sources of ionising radiation include: Ultraviolet light from the sun — this increases the risk of skin cancers such as melanoma (protection includes sunscreen and sensible clothing), radioactive materials found in the soil, water, and air. Medical and dental X-rays. Accidents in nuclear power generation, especially accidents such as the one in Chernobyl, Ukraine in 1986, can spread ionising radiation over wide areas.

Disease and bioenergetics,Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis,"All organisms, including plants and algae, need food for respiration, growth, and reproduction. However, plants don't need to eat — they can make their own food by photosynthesis. This takes place in the green parts of plants (especially the leaves) when it is light. Algae can also carry out photosynthesis. The cells in algae and plant leaves are full of small green parts called chloroplasts, which contain a green substance called chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, energy is transferred from the environment to the chloroplasts by light. This energy is then transferred to convert carbon dioxide (CO,) from the air, plus water (H2O) from the soil into a simple sugar called glucose. The chemical reaction also produces oxygen gas (02) as a by-product. The oxygen is released into the air, which you can then use when you breathe it in. Every year plants produce about 368000000000 tonnes of oxygen, so there is plenty to go around. Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction — it needs an input of energy from the environment. The energy transferred from the environment when the bonds holding carbon dioxide and water are broken is more than that transferred back to the environment with the formation of the new bonds in glucose and oxygen. The extra energy required for the reaction to take place is transferred from the environment by light. Some of the glucose produced during photosynthesis is used immediately by the cells of the plant for respiration. However, a lot of the glucose is converted into insoluble starch and stored. For photosynthesis to be successful, a plant needs plenty of carbon dioxide, light, and water. The leaves of plants are perfectly adapted as organs of photosynthesis because: most leaves are broad, giving them a big surface area for light to fall on, most leaves are thin so diffusion distances for the gases are short , they contain chlorophyll in the chloroplasts to absorb light , they have veins, which bring plenty of water in the xylem to the cells of the leaves and remove the products of photosynthesis in the phloem , they have air spaces that allow carbon dioxide to get to the cells, and oxygen to leave by diffusion and they have guard cells that open and close the stomata to regulate gas exchange. These adaptations mean that the plant can photosynthesise as much as possible whenever there is light available. Algae are aquatic so they are adapted to photosynthesising in water. They have a large surface area and absorb carbon dioxide dissolved in the water around them. The oxygen they produce also dissolves in the water around them as it is released.

Disease and bioenergetics,Photosynthesis,The rate of photosynthesis,"You may have noticed that plants grow quickly in the summer, yet they hardly grow at all in the winter. Plants need light, warmth, and carbon dioxide if they are going to photosynthesise and grow as fast as they can. Sometimes any one or more of these things can be in short supply and limit the amount of photosynthesis a plant can manage. This is why they are known as limiting factors. The most obvious factor affecting the rate of photosynthesis is light intensity. If there is plenty of light, lots of photosynthesis can take place. If there is very little or no light, photosynthesis will stop, whatever the other conditions are around the plant. For most plants, the brighter the light, the faster the rate of photosynthesis. Temperature affects all chemical reactions, including photosynthesis. As the temperature rises, the rate of photosynthesis increases as the reaction speeds up. However, photosynthesis is controlled by enzymes. Most enzymes are denatured once the temperature rises to around 40-50°C. If the temperature gets too high, the enzymes controlling photosynthesis are denatured and the rate of photosynthesis will fall. Plants need carbon dioxide to make glucose. The atmosphere is only about 0.04% carbon dioxide. This means carbon dioxide often limits the rate of photosynthesis. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration will increase the rate of photosynthesis. On a sunny day, carbon dioxide concentration is the most common limiting factor for plants. The carbon dioxide concentrations around a plant tend to rise at night, because in the dark a plant respires but doesn’t photosynthesise. As light intensity end temperature increase in the morning, most of the carbon dioxide around the plant gets used up. In a science lab or a greenhouse, the levels of carbon dioxide can be increased artificially. This means that carbon dioxide is no longer the limiting factor. Then the rate of photosynthesis increases with the rise in carbon dioxide concentration. In a garden, woodland or field (rather than a lab or greenhouse, where conditions can be controlled), light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentrations interact, and any one of them might be the factor that limits photosynthesis. You can investigate the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis. At the beginning of the investigation, the rate of photosynthesis in the water plant increases as the light is moved closer to the plant, which increases the light intensity. This tells us that light is acting as a limiting factor. When the light is moved further away from the water plant the rate of photosynthesis falls, shown by a slowing down in the stream of bubbles produced. If the light is moved closer again the stream of bubbles becomes faster, showing an increased rate of photosynthesis. We often add a heat shield to the apparatus. This helps keep the temperature of the water around the plant constant regardless of the position of the light source. Eventually, no matter how close the light, the rate of photosynthesis stays the same. At this point, light is no longer limiting the rate of photosynthesis. Something else has become the limiting factor. The results can be plotted on a graph showing the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis. If the amount of chlorophyll in a leaf is limited in any way, less photosynthesis will take place. The leaves of some ornamental plants have white, chlorophyll-free areas. These plants grow less vigorously than plants with all green leaves If they are permanently in dim light, variegated leaves often turn completely green. If a plant does not have enough minerals, especially magnesium, it cannot make chlorophyll. The
rate of photosynthesis drops and eventually the plant may die.

Disease and bioenergetics,Photosynthesis,How plants use glucose,"Plants make food by photosynthesis in their leaves and other green parts. Algae also photosynthesize. So how do they use the glucose they make? Plant cells and algal cells, like any other living cells, respire all the time. They use some of the glucose produced during photosynthesis as they respire. The glucose is broken down using oxygen to provide energy for the cells. Carbon dioxide and water are the waste products of the reaction. Chemically, respiration is the reverse of photosynthesis. Energy transferred in respiration may be used to build smaller molecules into bigger molecules. For example, plants build up glucose into complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. They use this to strengthen their cell walls.
Plants convert some of the glucose produced in photosynthesis into starch to be stored. Glucose is soluble in water. If it were stored in plant cells, it could affect the way water moves into and out of the cells by osmosis. Lots of glucose stored in plant cells could affect the water balance of the whole plant. Starch is insoluble in water. It has no effect on the water balance of the plant so plants can store large amounts of starch in their cells. Starch is the main energy store in plants, and it is found in cells all over a plant: Starch is stored in the cells of the leaves. It provides an energy store for when it is dark or when light levels are low. Starch is also kept in special storage areas of a plant. For example, many plants produce tubers and bulbs that are full of stored starch, to help them survive through the winter. Humans often take advantage of these starch stores, found as vegetables such as potatoes and onions. The presence of starch in a leaf is evidence that photosynthesis has taken place. You can test for starch using the iodine solution test and also use this test to show that light is vital for photosynthesis to take place. Take a leaf from a plant kept in the light and a plant kept in the dark for at least 24 hours. Just adding iodine solution to a leaf does not work, because the waterproof cuticle keeps the iodine out. Leaves have to be specially prepared so the iodine solution can reach the cells and react with any starch stored there. Also, the green chlorophyll would mask any colour changes if the iodine did react with the starch. You therefore need to treat the leaves by boiling them in ethanol, to destroy the waxy cuticle and then to remove the colour. The leaves are then rinsed in hot water to soften them. After treating the leaves, add iodine solution to them both. Iodine solution turns blue-black in the presence of starch. Plants use some of the glucose from photosynthesis to make amino acids. They do this by combining sugars with nitrate ions and other mineral ions from the soil. These amino acids are then built up into proteins to be used in the plant cells in many ways, including as enzymes. This uses energy from respiration. Algae also make amino acids. They do this by taking the nitrate ions and other minerals they need from the water they live in. Very few plants can survive well if the soil they are growing in is low in minerals. For example, bogs are wet, and their peaty soil has very few nutrients in it. This makes it a difficult place for plants to live. Some carnivorous plants, such as pitcher plants, Venus flytraps, and sundews are especially adapted to live in nitrate-poor soil. They can survive because they obtain most of their nutrients from the animals, such as insects, that they catch. The plants produce enzymes to digest the insects they trap. They then use nitrates and other minerals from the digested bodies of their victims in place of the nutrients they cannot get from the bog soil in which they grow. After an insect has been digested, the trap reopens, ready to try again. Plants and algae use some of the glucose from photosynthesis and energy transferred from respiration to build up fats and oils. These may be used in the cells as an energy store. They are sometimes used in the cell walls to make them stronger. In addition, plants often use fats or oils as an energy store in their seeds. Seeds provide food for the new plant to respire as it germinates. Some algal cells are also very rich in oils. They are even being considered as a possible source of biofuels for the future.

Disease and bioenergetics,Respiration,Aerobic respiration,"One of the most important enzyme-controlled processes in living things is aerobic respiration. It takes place all the time in plant and animal cells.
Your digestive system, lungs, and circulation all work to provide your cells with the glucose and oxygen they need for respiration.
During aerobic respiration, glucose (a sugar) reacts with oxygen. This reaction transfers energy that your cells can use.This energy is vital for everything that goes on in your body,
Carbon dioxide and water are produced as waste products of the reaction. The process is called aerobic respiration because it uses oxygen from the air.
Aerobic respiration is an exothermic reaction. Exothermic reactions transfer energy to the environment — more energy is transferred to the environment when new bonds are formed in the products than is taken in to break the bonds in the reactants. Some of the energy transferred in respiration is used for all of the reactions that take place inside a cell.The rest of the energy is transferred to the environment, making it slightly warmer. The average energy needs of a teenage boy are around 1 1 510kJ daily, but teenage girls only need 8830kJ a day. This is partly because, on average, girls are smaller than boys, and also because boys have more muscle cells. More muscle cells mean more mitochondria requiring fuel for aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration involves lots of chemical reactions. Each reaction is controlled by a different enzyme. Most of these reactions take place in the mitochondria of your cells.
Mitochondria are tiny rod-shaped parts (organelles) that are found in almost all plant and animal cells as well as in fungal and algal cells.They have a folded inner membrane that provides a large surface area for the enzymes involved in aerobic respiration.The number of mitochondria in a cell shows you how active the cell is. The energy transferred during respiration supplies all the energy needs
for living processes in the cells: Living cells need energy to carry out the basic functions of life. They build up large molecules from smaller ones to make new cell material. Much of the energy transferred in respiration is used for these ‘buiIding’activities (synthesis reactions). Energy is also transferred to break down larger molecules to smaller ones, both during digestion and within the cells themselves.  In animals, energy from respiration is transferred to make muscles contract. Muscles are working all the time in your body. Even when you sleep, your heart bear, you breathe, and your stomach churns. All muscular activities require energy. Mammals and birds maintain a constant internal body temperature almost regardless of the temperature of their surroundings. On cold days energy transferred from respiration helps you to stay warm, while on not days you sweat and transfer energy to your surroundings to keep your body cool. In plants, energy from respiration is transferred to move mineral ions such as nitrates from the soil into root hair cells. It is also transferred to convert sugars, nitrates. and other nutrients into amino acids, which are then built up into proteins. ","What happens during aerobic respiration?

Disease and bioenergetics,Respiration,The response to exercise,"Your muscles require a lot of energy to carry out their functions. They move you around and help support your body against gravity. Your heart is made of muscle and pumps blood around your body. The movement of food through your digestive system depends on muscles too.
Muscle tissue is made up of protein fibres that contract when energy is transferred from respiration. Muscle fibres need a lot of energy to contract. They contain many mitochondria to carry out aerobic respiration and transfer the energy needed. Muscle fibres usually occur in big blocks or groups, which contract to cause movement. They then relax, which allows other muscles to work.
Your muscles also store glucose as the carbohydrate glycogen. Glycogen can be converted rapidly back to glucose to use during exercise. The glucose is used in aerobic respiration to transfer the energy needed to make your muscles contract. Even when you are not moving about, your muscles use up a certain amount of oxygen and glucose. However, when you begin to exercise, many muscles start contracting harder and faster. As a result, they need more glucose and oxygen for respiration. During exercise the muscles also produce increased amounts of carbon dioxide. This needs to be removed for muscles to keep working effectively.
During exercise, when muscular activity increases, several changes take place in your body: Your heart rate increases and the arteries supplying blood to your muscles dilate (widen). These changes increase the flow of oxygenated blood to your exercising muscles. This in turn increases the rate of supply of oxygen and glucose for the increased cellular respiration rate needed. It also increases the rate that carbon dioxide is removed from the muscles. Your breathing rate increases and you breathe more deeply. This means you breathe more often and also bring more air into your lungs each time you breathe in. The rate at which oxygen is brought into your body and picked up by your red blood cells is increased, and this oxygen is carried to your exercising muscles. It also means that carbon dioxide can be removed more quickly from the blood in the lungs and breathed out. Glycogen stored in the muscles is converted back to glucose, to supply the cells with the fuel they need for increased cellular respiration. In this way, the heart rate and breathing rate increase during exercise to supply the muscles with what they need and remove the extra waste produced. Cellular respiration increases to supply the muscle cells with the increased levels of energy needed for contraction during exercise. The increase in your breathing and heart rate is to keep up with the demands of the cells.

Disease and bioenergetics,Respiration,Anaerobic respiration,"Your everyday muscle movements use energy transferred by aerobic respiration. However, when you exercise hard, your muscle cells may become short of oxygen. Although you increase your heart and breathing rates, sometimes the blood cannot supply oxygen to the muscles fast enough. When this happens, energy from the breakdown of glucose can still be transferred lathe muscle cells. They use anaerobic respiration, which takes place without oxygen. Anaerobic respiration is not as efficient as aerobic respiration because the glucose molecules are not broken down completely. In animal cells the end product of anaerobic respiration is lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide and water. Because the breakdown of glucose is incomplete, far less energy is transferred than during aerobic respiration. Using your muscle fibres vigorously for a long time can make them become fatigued and they stop contracting efficiently. One cause of this muscle fatigue is the build-up of lactic acid, produced by anaerobic respiration in the muscle cells. The build-up of lactic acid in the muscles as a result of anaerobic respiration creates an oxygen debt.
For example, repeated movements can soon lead to anaerobic respiration in your muscles — particularly if you’re not used to the exercise. If you are fit, your heart and lungs will be able to keep a good supply of oxygen going to your muscles while you exercise for a relatively long time. If you are unfit, your muscles will run short of oxygen much sooner. Humans and other animals are not the only living organisms that can respire anaerobically. Plants and microorganisms can also respire without oxygen. However, when plant cells respire anaerobically, they do not form lactic acid — they form ethanol and carbon dioxide. Some microorganisms form lactic acid during anaerobic respiration —the bacteria used to form yoghurts, for example. Other microorganisms, including yeast, form ethanol and carbon dioxide. Anaerobic respiration in yeast cells is known as fermentation. People have made use of this for thousands of years. It is a very economically important reaction because it is used globally in the manufacture of bread and alcoholic drink.

Disease and bioenergetics,Respiration, Metabolism and the liver,"The metabolism of an organism is the sum of all the reactions that take place in a cell or in the body. Some of the energy transferred by respiration reactions in cells simply heats the environment. However,
 some of it is used by the organism for the continual enzyme-controlled processes of metabolism that make molecules or break them down. It is used to bring about change and movement where needed. The energy transferred by respiration in animals is also used to enable the muscles to contract. In mammals and birds it is also used to maintain a constant body temperature. There are hundreds of thousands of metabolic reactions but you don’t have to learn them all. Some of the most common metabolic reactions include: the Conversion of glucose to starch, glycogen, and cellulose, the formation of lipid molecules from a molecule of glycerol and three fatty acid molecules, the use of glucose and nitrate ions to form amino acids that are then used to make proteins, the reactions of respiration, the reactions of photosynthesis, the breakdown of excess proteins in the liver to form urea for excretion. Your liver is a large reddish-brown organ that carries out many different functions in your body. Liver cells grow and regenerate themselves very rapidly. The liver is a very active organ with many different metabolic functions. These include: detoxifying poisonous substances such as the ethanol from alcoholic drinks, passing the breakdown products into the blood so they can be excreted in the urine via the kidneys, breaking down old, worn out blood cells and storing the iron until it is needed to synthesise more blood cells. One important role of the liver is in dealing with the tactic acid produced by the muscles during anaerobic respiration. Blood flowing through the muscles transports the lactic acid to the liver where it is converted back into glucose. The oxygen debt is repaid once the lactic acid has been converted back to glucose and the glucose has been completely broken down in aerobic respiration to form carbon dioxide and water. If it isn’t needed, the glucose made from the lactic acid may be converted to glycogen and stored in the liver until it is needed.","What is metabolism?

Biological responses,The human nervous system,Principles of homeostasis,"Human beings live everywhere from the equator to the Antarctic. People survive wearing no clothes or many clothes, running a marathon, or never moving from a computer screen. Conditions can change dramatically around us and even inside us and yet we survive. How do we do it ? The conditions inside your body are known as its internal environment. Your organs cannot work properly if this keeps changing. Many of the processes that go on inside your body aim to keep everything as constant as possible. As well as the body as a whole, this includes the regulation of the internal conditions of cells to maintain optimum conditions for functioning, in response to internal or external changes. This balancing act is called homeostasis. You know that enzymes only work at their best in specific conditions of temperature and pH. Enzymes control all the functions of a cell. The functioning of individual cells is vital for the way tissues, organs, and whole organisms work. It is important to respond to changes in the
 internal or external environment to maintain optimum conditions for the cellular enzymes. Internal conditions that are controlled include: body temperature, the water content of the body and the blood glucose concentration. Homeostasis involves coordination and control. Organisms need to be aware of changes in the world around them, such as changes in
 temperature or levels of sunlight. They also need to respond to changes in the internal environment. When you exercise your muscles get hotter, when you have eaten a meal your blood sugar levels go up, and in hot weather you lose water and salt through sweating.
 Detecting changes and responding to them involves automatic control systems. These automatic systems include nervous responses in your nervous system and chemical responses in your hormone system. They also involve many of your body organs. All control systems in the body need certain Key features to function: Receptors: cells that detect changes in the internal or external environment. These changes are known as stimuli. Receptors may be part of the nervous or the hormonal control systems of the body, Coordination centres: areas that receive and process the information from the receptors. They send out signals and coordinate the response of the body. They include the brain, which acts as
 a coordination centre for both the nervous system and parts of the hormonal system, the spinal cord, and some organs such as the pancreas. Effectors: muscles or glands that bring about responses to the stimulus that has been received. These responses restore conditions in the body to the optimum levels.","Describe Homeostasis ?

Biological responses,The human nervous system,The structure and function of the nervous system,"You need to know what is going on in the world around you. Your nervous system makes this possible. It enables you to react to your surroundings and coordinate your behaviour. Your nervous system carries electrical signals (impulses) that travel fast — between 1 and 120 metres per second. This means you can react to changes in your surroundings very quickly. As with most animals, you need to avoid danger, find food, and eventually find a mate. This is where your nervous system helps. Your body is particularly sensitive to changes in the world around you. Any changes (known as stimuli) are picked up by cells called receptors. Receptor cells, such as the light receptor cells in your eyes, are similar to most animal cells. They have a nucleus, cytoplasm, and a cell membrane. These receptors are usually found clustered together in special sense organs, such as your eyes and your skin. You have many different types of sensory receptor. Some male moths have receptors so sensitive they can detect the scent of a female several kilometres away and follow the scent trail to find her. Once a sensory receptor detects a stimulus, the information is sent as an electrical impulse that passes along special cells called neurones. These are usually found in bundles of hundreds or even thousands of neurones known as nerves.
The impulse travels along the neurone until it reaches the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. The cells that carry impulses from your sense organs to your CNS are called sensory neurones. Your brain gets huge amounts of information from all the sensory receptors in your body. It coordinates the response to the information, and sends impulses out along special cells. These cells, piled motor neurones, carry information from the CNS to the rest of your body. They carry impulses to make the right bits of your body — the effectors — respond.Effectors may be muscles or glands. Your muscles respond to the arrival of impulses by contracting. Your glands respond by releasing (secreting) chemical substances. For example, your salivary glands produce and release extra saliva when you smell food cooking. And your pancreas releases the hormone insulin when your blood sugar levels go up after a meal. The receptor sends an impulse along a sensory neurone, carrying information about d change in the environment to the coordinator (CNS). Be careful to use the terms neurone and nerve correctly.Talk about impulses (not messages) travelling along a neurone. Once all the incoming information has been processed, the coordinator sends impulses down motor neurones. These motor impulses stimulate the effectors to bring about the responses needed in any particular situation.","Describe the main function of the nervous system ?

Biological responses,The human nervous system,Reflex actions,"Your nervous system lets you take in information from your surroundings and respond in the fight way. However, some of your responses are so fast that they happen without giving you time to think. When you touch something hot, or sharp, you pull your hand back before you feel the pain. If something comes near your face, you blink. Automatic responses like these are known as reflexes. Reflexes are very important both for human and other animals. They help you to avoid danger or harm because they happen so fast. There are also lots of reflexes that take care of your basic body functions. These functions include breathing and moving food through your digestive system. Reflexes are automatic and rapid — they do not involve the conscious part of your brain. It would make life very difficult if you had to think consciously about those things all the time — and it would be fatal if you forgot to breathe! Simple reflex actions such as the pain withdrawal reflex, we are all familiar with, often involve just three types of neurone. These are: sensory neurones, motor neurones, relay neurones - these connect the sensory neurone and a motor neurone and are found in the CNS. An electrical impulse pulse from the receptor along the sensory neurone to the CNS. It then passes along a relay neurone (usually in the spinal cord) and straight back along the motor neurone. From there, the impulse arrives at the effector organ. The effector organ will be a muscle or a gland. We call this pathway a reflex arc.
 The key point in a reflex arc is that the impulse bypasses the conscious areas of your brain. The result is that the time between the stimulus and the reflex action is as short as possible. Your neurones are not joined up directly to each other. There are junctions between them called synapses which form physical gaps between the neurones. The electrical impulses travelling along your neurones have to cross these synapses. They cannot leap the gap. The diffusion of the chemical across the synapse is slower than the electrical impulse in the neurones, but it makes it possible for the impulse to cross the gap between them. The following happens when you touch a hot object: When you touch the object, a receptor in your skin is stimulated. An electrical impulse from a receptor passes along a sensory neurone to the CNS — in this case, the spinal cord, when an impulse from the sensory neurone arrives at the synapse with a relay neurone, a chemical is released. The chemical diffuses across the synapse to the relay neurone where it sets off a new electrical impulse that travels along the relay neurone. When the impulse reaches the synapse between the relay neurone and a motor neurone returning to the arm, another chemical is released. Again, the chemical diffuses across the synapse and slam a new electrical impulse travelling down the motor neurone to the effector. When the impulse reaches the effector organ, it is stimulated to respond. In this example, the impulses arrive in the muscles of the arm, causing them to contract. This action moves the hand rapidly away from the source of pain. If the effector organ is a gland, it will respond by releasing (secreting) chemical substances. The reflex pathway is not very different from a normal conscious action. However, in a reflex action the coordinator is a relay neurone either in the spinal cord or in the unconscious areas of the brain. The whole reflex is very fast indeed. An impulse also travels up the spinal cord to the conscious areas of your brain. You know about the reflex action, but only after it has happened.","Why are reflexes important?

Biological responses,The human nervous system,The brain,"Information from sensory receptors all over your body feeds into your brain. In the brain this information is processed and then impulses are sent out along the motor neurones that coordinate your responses to all the different situations you meet. Your brain controls everything from walking to complex behaviour as well as your thoughts and feelings.
 Scientists are finding out more about the brain all the time, but it is still in many ways a mystery. Your brain is kept protected inside the bones of your skull and is encased in protective membranes called the meninges. The brain itself has a texture rather like set yoghurt. It is made up of billions of interconnected neurones that form different regions. The different regions of the brain carry out different functions. For example: The cerebral cortex is concerned with consciousness, intelligence, memory, and language. The cerebellum is concerned mainly with coordinating muscular activity and balance. The medulla is concerned with unconscious activities, such as controlling the heartbeat, the movements of the gut, and breathing. The brain has many other specialised areas. For example, the hypothalamus is involved in controlling body temperature, while the pituitary gland produces many different chemicals (hormones) which play a big pan in coordinating and controlling body systems. Since the brain is inside the skull, it has not been easy to find out exactly how it works. Scientists use several different techniques to help them. Over many years it has been possible to discover the role of different areas of the brain when people suffer from brain damage. Matching the changes in behaviour or memory with the damaged area has helped scientists map the functions of some parts of the brain. For example, in 1848 an explosives accident blew an iron rod through the skull of 25 year old Phineas Gage. Amazingly he survived for 13 years but the polite, hardworking, young man became wild, rude and unreliable. Modern scans show that the accident removed part of Gage's cerebral cortex, including the area which controls social inhibitions. Modern scientists can explain the changes observed almost two centuries ago.","Describe what the brain is made up of?

Biological responses,The human nervous system,The Eye,"Sight is an important sense for many animals, including humans.
 The reason humans can see so well is largely due to having complex eyes. The eye is a sense organ containing many receptors that are sensitive to light intensity and colour. All the light-sensitive cells are arranged together inside the back of the eye in a special light sensitive layer known as the retina. The sclera is the white outer layer of the eye. It is relatively tough and strong, so the eyeball is not easy to damage. The sclera has a transparent area at the front of the eyeball called the cornea. This lets light into the eye. The curved surface of the cornea is also very important for changing the direction of the light rays coming into the eye, making sure that as they enter the eye they are focused on the retina. The muscular iris controls the size of the pupil — the hole through which light enters the eye. The iris is made of muscles that contract or relax to change the size of the pupil arid so control the amount of light reaching the retina. In dim light, the pupil is enlarged so as much light as possible enters the eye. In bright light, the iris makes the pupil very small. This reduces the amount of light that goes into the eye, so that too much bright light does not damage the delicate, light-sensitive cells. Once through the pupil, light passes through a clear disc — the lens. The lens is held in place by suspensory ligament and the ciliary muscles. It is the lens of the eye that ’fine tunes’ the focusing of the light rays, changing their direction to produce a clear image on the retina. The eyeball is filled with a thick transparent jelly that maintains its spherical shape. When light hits the retina, the light-sensitive cells are stimulated. They send impulses to the brain along sensory neurones in the optic nerve When the brain receives these messages it interprets them as a visual image— in other words, you see something! The point where the optic nerve leaves the eye has no retina so there is a blind spot. You are unaware of the blind spot because the brain fills in the gap, although you can find ways to find it. The light that enters the eyes has to be focused on the light-sensitive cells of the retina so that you can see clearly. If the light is focused in front or behind the retina the image will be blurred. The light gets focused by the process of reff6Ction, where light changes direction as it passes through the eye. The Cornea and the jelly in the eyeball change the direction of the light rays onto the retina, but they always retract it the same amount. The shape of the lens of the eye Can be changed by the contraction or relaxation of the Ciliary muscles. This Changes the amount the lens retracts the light, and this is important for seeing both close and distant objects in focus. The basic principle of how an image is formed on the retina is shown in Figure 4. The image formed is upside down — but our brains interpret the image as the right way up!","Name a main component of the human eye?

Genetics and reproduction,Reproduction,Types of reproduction,"Reproduction is essential to living things. It is during reproduction that genetic information in the chromosomes is passed on from parents to their offspring. There are two very different ways of reproducing — asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction only involves one parent. The cells divide by mitosis. There is no joining (fusion) of special sex cells (gametes) and so there is no mixing of genetic information. As a result, there is no variation in the offspring. Asexual reproduction gives rise to genetically identical offspring known as clones. Their genetic material is identical both to the parent and to each other. Only mitosis is involved in asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is very common in the smallest animals and plants, and in fungi and bacteria. However, many larger plants, such as daffodils, strawberries, and brambles, can also reproduce asexually. The cells of your body reproduce asexually all the time. They divide into two identical cells for growth and to replace worn-out tissues. Sexual reproduction involves a male sex cell and a female sex cell from two parents. These two special sex cells (gametes) fuse together to form a zygote, which goes on to develop into a new individual. Gametes
 are formed in a special form of cell division known as meiosis. The chromosome number of the original cell is halved, so that when gametes join together, the new cell has the right number of chromosomes. The offspring that result from sexual reproduction inherit genetic information from both parents. They will have some characteristics from both parents but won’t be identical to either of them. This introduces variation. The offspring of sexual reproduction show much more variation than the offspring from asexual reproduction. In plants, the gametes are the egg cells and pollen. In animals, the gametes are the egg cells (ova) and sperm. Sexual reproduction is risky because it relies on two sex cells, often from two individuals, meeting and fusing. However. it also introduces variation, which is key to the long-term survival of a species. That’s why sexual reproduction takes place in living things ranging from single-celled organisms to humans.","Define asexual reproduction?

Genetics and reproduction,Reproduction,Cell dicision in sexual reproduction,"Mitosis takes place all the time, in tissues all over your body and whenever organisms reproduce asexually. There is, however, another type of cell division that takes place in the reproductive organs of animals and plants. In humans, these organs are the ovaries and the testes. Meiosis results in sex cells, called gametes, which have only half the original number of chromosomes. In animals, the female gametes (egg cells or ova) are made in the ovaries. The male gametes (sperm) are made in the testes. The gametes are formed by meiosis. In meiosis, the chromosome number is reduced by half. In a body cell there are two sets of each chromosome, one inherited from the mother and one from the father. When a cell divides to form gametes: The genetic information is copied so there are four sets of each chromosome instead of the normal two sets. Each chromosome forms a pair of chromatids. This is very similar to mitosis. The cell then divides twice in quick succession to form four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomes. Each gamete that is produced is genetically different from all the others. Gametes contain random mixtures of the original chromosomes. This introduced variation. The testes can produce around 400 million sperm by meiosis every 24 hours. Only one sperm is needed to fertilise an egg, but each sperm needs to travel 100000 times its own length to reach the egg. Less than one sperm in a million actually make it. More variation is added when fertilisation takes place. Each sex cell has a single set of chromosomes. When two Sex cells join during fertilisation, the single new cell formed has a full set of chromosomes. In humans, the egg cell has 23 chromosomes and so does the sperm. When they join together, they produce a single new body cell with 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs — the correct number of chromosomes for human body cells. The combination of genes on the chromosomes of every newly fertilised egg is unique. Once fertilisation is complete, the unique new cell begins to divide by mitosis to form a new individual. The number of cells increases rapidly. As the embryo develops, the cells differentiate to form tissues, organs and organ systems. The differences between asexual and sexual reproduction are reflected in the different types of cell division involved.
 In asexual reproduction, the offspring are produced as a result of mitosis from the parent cells. They contain exactly the same chromosomes and the same genes as their parents. There is no variation in the genetic material. In sexual reproduction, the gametes are produced by meiosis in the sex organs of the parents. This introduces variation as each gamete is different. Then, when the gametes fuse, one of each pair of chromosomes, and so one of each pair of genes, comes from each parent, adding more variation. The combination of genes in the new pair of chromosomes will contain different forms of the same genes (alleles) from each parent. This also helps to produce variation in the characteristics of the offspring.","How many pairs of chromosomes are there in a normal human body cell?

Genetics and reproduction,Reproduction,DNA and the genome,"Each different type of organism has a different number of chromosomes in their body cells. For example, humans have 46 chromosomes, potatoes have 48, and chickens have 78. In animals and flowering plants, chromosomes always come in pairs. You have 23 pairs of chromosomes in all your normal body cells. You inherit half your chromosomes from your mother and half from your father. Inside the nuclei of all your cells, your chromosomes are made up of long molecules of a chemical known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA is a polymer, a long molecule made up of many repeating units. These very long strands of DNA twist and spiral to form a double helix structure. Your genes are small sections of this DNA. This is where the genetic information — the coded information that determines inherited characteristics — is actually stored. Each of your chromosomes contains thousands of genes joined together. Each gene codes for a particular sequence of amino acids to make a specific protein. These proteins include the enzymes that control your cell chemistry. This is how the relationship between the genes and the whole organism builds up. The genes control the proteins, which control the make up of the different specialised cells that form tissues. These tissues then form organs and organ systems that make up the whole body. In 2003, scientists announced that they had managed to sequence the human genome, Working in teams all around the world, the Human Genome Project finished two years early, and under budget. This was because the technology used to chop up the DNA and read all the base sequences had improved so fast during the life of the project. It was a scientific triumph — but why does it matter? The genome of an organism is the entire genetic material often organism. That includes all of the chromosomes, and the genetic material found In the mitochondria as well. Mitochondria contain their own DNA, You always inherit your mitochondrial DNA from your mother because it comes from the mitochondria in the egg. The human genome contains over 3 billion base pairs and almost 21000 genes that code for proteins. That sounds a lot until you discover
 that rice has 36000 Coding genes! We are not simpler than rice. The human genome has the ability to make many different proteins from the same gene by using it in different ways, or by switching part of a gene on or off. Since the initial human genome was read, scientists have carried on with the work. They went on to sequence the genomes of 1000 people, and 
 now they are busy with the current 100000 genomes project. The aim is to find out as much as possible about human DNA. It isn’t just human genomes that are sequenced. Scientists are sequencing the genomes of hundreds of different species of organisms. They use similarities and differences in the genomes to help them work out the relationships between different types of organisms. It is changing the way we classify living things. Sequencing the genomes of bacteria and viruses allows us to Identify the causes of disease very rapidly and to choose the correct treatment. Understanding the human genome has taken years of work and billions of pounds — and there is still a great deal to find out. There are many reasons why scientists feel that all of this effort is worthwhile. Understanding the human genome helps us to understand inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. The more we can understand what goes wrong in these diseases, the more chance we nave of overcoming them either through medicines or by repairing the faulty genes. There are genes that are linked to an increased risk of developing many diseases, from heart disease to type 2 diabetes. Understanding the human genome is playing a massive part in the search for genes linked to different types of diseases. The more we understand about the genome, the more likely we are to predict the risk for each individual, so they can make lifestyle choices to help reduce the risks. This includes the changes that happen in the genome when a cancer develops. By analysing the genomes of cancer cells, scientists and doctors hope to become even better at choosing the best treatment foreach individual. Understanding the human genome helps us understand human evolution and history. People all over the world can be linked by patterns in their DNA, allowing scientists to trace human migration patterns from our ancient history. We can also be linked to early members of the human family tree. For example, most people have a small number of Neanderthal genes in their DNA, even though that branch of the human family died out around 40000 years ago.","What is the genome of an organism?

Genetics and reproduction,Reproduction,DNA structure and protein synthesis,"DNA is found in the nucleus of your cells and controls protein synthesis. But proteins are synthesised in the cytoplasm of the cell on the ribosomes. How does the DNA bring about this control?
 The long strands of your DNA are made up of alternating sugar and phosphate sections.These make up the backbone of the molecule. Attached to each sugar is one of four different Compounds called bases. The bases are represented by the letters A, C, G and T. The combination of a sugar, a phosphate, and a base is called a nucleotide. The DNA polymer is made up of repeating nucleotide units. The nucleotide units are grouped into threes, and each group of three bases codes for a particular amino acid. Each gene is made up of hundreds or thousands of these bases. The order of the bases controls the order in which the amino acids are assembled to produce a particular protein for use in your body cells. Each gene codes for a particular combination of amino acids, which make a specific protein. A change or mutation in a single group of bases can be enough to change or disrupt the whole protein structure and the way it works. The key to the structure and functioning of the DNA molecule is the way these bases join up. In the complementary strands of the DNA molecule, a C is always linked to a G on the opposite strand. Similarly, T is always linked to A. This holds the structure of the DNA double helix together. It is also key in the way the information from the genes on the DNA is translated into proteins in the cell. Protein synthesis in the cell is controlled by the DNA in the nucleus in a sophisticated series of steps. Genes in the DNA produce a template for the protein. The template reflects the sequence of bases in the DNA, but is small enough to leave the nucleus through the pores in the nuclear membrane. The template leaves the nucleus and binds to the surface of a ribosome. The cytoplasm contains carrier molecules, each attached to a specific amino acid. The carrier molecules attach themselves to the template in the order given by the DNA. The amino acids are joined together to form a specific protein. Carrier molecules keep bringing specific amino acids to add to the growing protein chain in the correct order until the template is completed. The protein detaches from the carrier molecules and the carrier molecules detach from the template and return to the cytoplasm to pick up more amino acids. Once the protein chain is complete the molecule folds up to form a unique shape that will enable it to carry out its functions in the cell. For example ,if the protein is going to act as an enzyme, it will fold to produce the active Site. If it is a structural protein it will form fibrous structures such as collagen. If It is going to act as a hormone, or a clotting factor in the blood, or a muscle, or part of the structure of the cell membrane, the protein will fold so it can carry out its specific job in the cell. This is how DNA controls protein synthesis.","Define a DNA base ?

Genetics and reproduction,Reproduction,Gene expression and mutation,"Our understanding of how the genetic code in our cells produces organisms we see around us is growing all the time. Not only do we understand what happens when things go wrong as the DNA in our cells replicate. We are also beginning to understand how genes are switched on and off in our cells as we grow and develop. It seems as if our environment may affect exactly which genes come into use. When a gene codes for a protein that is synthesised in the cell, the gene is said to be expressed. Most of the DNA does not actually code for proteins, remember that there are only 21 000 genes but 3 billion pairs of bases! Scientists are still discovering what the non-coding part of the DNA does. One thing they have discovered is that the non-coding pans of the DNA are involved in switching genes, or parts of genes, on and off.The non- coding DNA is part of the answer to the question of how we can synthesise so many different chemicals with so few genes. Each gene can control the synthesis of lots of different proteins. This may depend on how much of a gene is switched on or off, or which other genes are switched on or off at the same time. Scientists think that variations in the non-coding areas of our DNA may affect how our genes are expressed. This in turn affects the phenotype - the physical appearance or biochemistry of an organism. Mutation has a bad name — in horror movies it is shown as a dramatic event that brings about enormous and often horrifying changes. The truth is much less exciting but much more important. All of us are here now as a result of millions of mutations that have taken place in our DNA since the earliest days of life on Earth. New forms of genes result from changes in existing genes and these changes are what we call mutations. They are often tiny changes in the sequence of bases in a strand of DNA Mutations occur all the time, often as a result of mistakes made in copying the DNA for new cells as they reproduce. When mutations take place in the coding DNA, most do not alter the protein formed, or alter it so slightly that its appearance and function is not changed.
 A few mutations code for a change in the amino acids that results in an altered protein that folds to give a different shape. As a result, the active site of an enzyme may no longer fit the substrate, or a structural protein may lose its strength. On the other hand, the changes caused by a mutation may give an advantage eg producing a more efficient enzyme or a stronger structural protein. When mutations take place in the non-coding DNA, it does not directly affect the phenotype. However, variants in the non-coding DNA can affect which genes are switched on or switched off. By changing the genes that are expressed, changes in the non-coding DNA can have a big effect on the phenotype of the organism.","What is gene expression ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,History of genetics,"The models you have of the world around you, the ideas about genetics and evolution for example, did not arrive fully formed. Over time, ideas move forward as knowledge and understanding of the living world grows. It can be useful and informative to look at the way some of our key ideas in biology have developed, and to consider where they could go from here. Until about 150 years ago, people had no idea how genetic information passed from one generation to the next.Today, people can predict the outcome of a simple genetic cross.The man who first worked out these patterns was an Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel, who was born in 1822. As Mendel worked in the monastery gardens, he became fascinated by the peas growing there and carried out some breeding experiments using them. He used smooth peas, wrinkled peas, green peas and yellow peas for his work. Mendel cross-bred the peas and counted the different offspring carefully. He found that characteristics were inherited in Clear and predictable patterns. Mendel explained his results by suggesting there were separate units of inherited material. He realised that some characteristics were dominant over others and that they never mixed together. This was an amazing observation for a time when even chromosomes had not yet been discovered. Mendel kept records of everything he did and analysed his results. This was almost unheard of in those days. Eventually, in 1866, Mendel published his findings. He explained some of the basic laws of genetics using mathematical models in ways that we still use today. Mendel was ahead of his time. As no one knew about genes or Chromosomes, people simply didn’t understand his theories. Sixteen years after Mendel’s death in 1884, his work was finally accepted.
 By the late 19th century, people had seen chromosomes through a microscope. They had observed the ’dance of the chromosomes’ during cell division. Other scientists discovered Mendel’s papers and repeated his experiments. When they published their results, they gave Mendel the credit for what they observed. From then on, ideas about genetics developed rapidly. In the early 20th century, scientists observed that chromosomes and Mendel’s units of inheritance behaved in very similar ways. It was suggested that Mendel’s units of inheritance might be carried on the chromosomes seen under the microscope In this way, the science of genetics was born. Even when people had accepted Mendel’s ideas, they didn’t know what the genes were made of or how they were passed on. It wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists finally put together the evidence to show that DNA is the material of inheritance and to explain how it works. Lots of people were trying to solve the riddle of inheritance, especially two UK teams who were intense rivals. Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin in London were looking at the structure of DNA using X-rays. In the other team, James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge were trying to build a 3-D model of DNA that would explain how it works. In the end it was the Cambridge team who came up with the now famous double helix structure for the DNA molecule — using Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray results released without her permission by Maurice Wilkins. Once the structure was revealed, an explosion in genetic research took place. Before long the mechanism of gene function was worked out. Watson, Crick and Wilkins all received Nobel prizes for their work. Rosalind Franklin died of cancer before the prizes were awarded. The results of all this scientific work led to the development of the gene theory — that genes code for proteins and this is how they have their effect. As scientists begin to understand more about how the environment can affect the proteins made by a particular gene knowledge is moving forward again. But the fundamental understanding of genetics and some of the most common genetic diseases that affect people is still based in the work of Gregor Mendel all those years ago.","Describe the discovery of the DNA double helix ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Theories of evolution,"Humans are surrounded by an amazing variety of life on planet Earth. Questions such as ‘Where has it all come from?’ and ’When did life on Earth begin?’ have puzzled people for many generations.
 Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection tells us that all the species of living things alive today have evolved from the first simple life forms. Scientists think these early forms of life developed on Earth more than 3 billion years ago. Most of us take these ideas for granted, but they are really quite new.
 Up until the 18th century, most people in Europe believed that God had created the world. They thought it was made, as described in the Christian Bible, a few thousand years ago. However, by the beginning of the 19th century, scientists were beginning to come up with new ideas. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French biologist. He thought that all
 organisms were linked by what he called a ’fountain of life'. He made the great step forward of suggesting that individual animals adapted and evolved to suit their environment. His idea was that every type of animal evolved from primitive worms. The change from worms to other organisms was caused by the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
 Lamarck’s theory proposed that the way organisms behaved affected the features of their body — a case of ’use it or lose it’. If animals used something a lot over a lifetime, Lamarck thought this feature would grow and develop. Any useful changes that took place in an organism during its lifetime would be passed from a parent to its offspring. If a feature wasn‘t used, Lamarck thought it would shrink and be lost.
 Lamarck’s theory influenced the way Charles Darwin thought. However, there were several problems with Lamarck’s ideas. There was no evidence for his ’fountain of Iife’ and people didn’t like the idea of being descended from worms People could also see quite clearly that changes in their bodies, such as big muscles, for example were not passed on to their children.
 We now know that in the great majority of cases, Lamarck’s idea of inheritance cannot happen. However, his ideas paved the way for the scientists such as Darwin who followed him. Our modern ideas about evolution began with one of the most famous scientists of all time — Charles Darwin. Darwin set out in 1831 as the captain’s companion and ship’s geologist and naturalist on HMS Beagle. He was only 22 years old at the start of the round the world voyage to South America and the South Sea Islands. Darwin planned to study mainly geology on the trip, developing his knowledge of rocks and fossils. Yet as the voyage went on, he became as excited by his collection of animals and plants as by his rock samples.
 In South America, Darwin discovered a new form of the common rhea, an ostrich-like bird — although he had almost finished eating it before he noticed the differences! Finding two different types of the same bird living in slightly different areas set Darwin thinking.
 On the Galapagos Islands, Darwin was amazed by the variety of species. He noticed that they varied from island to island. Darwin found strong similarities between types of finches on the different islands. Yet each was different and adapted to make the most of local conditions
 Darwin collected huge numbers of specimens of animals and plants during the voyage. He also made detailed drawings and kept written observations. The long journey home gave him plenty of time to think about what he had seen. Charles Darwin returned home after five years with some new ideas forming in his mind.
 After returning to England, Darwin spent the next 20 years working on his ideas. Darwin’s theory is that all living organisms have evolved from simpler life forms. This evolution has come about by a process of natural selection. Darwin’s main ideas were: The individual organisms in a particular species tend to show a wide range of variation for each characteristic. Reproduction always gives more offspring than the environment can support. The organisms that have inherited the characteristics most suited to their environment — the’fittest'— are more likely to survive and breed successfully. When they breed, they pass on the characteristics that have enabled them to survive to the next generation. When Darwin suggested how evolution took place by natural selection, no one knew about genes. He simply observed that useful inherited characteristics were passed on. Today we know it is useful alleles that control the characteristics of the phenotype that are passed from parents to their offspring in natural selection.","Explain what is meant by evolution ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Accepting Darwin’s ideas ,"Charles Darwin came back from his trip on HMS Beagle with new ideas about the variety of life on Earth. He read numerous books and thought about the ideas of many other people, such as Lamarck, Lyell, and Malthus. He gradually built up his theory of evolution by natural selection.
 Darwin knew his ideas would be controversial. He expected a lot of opposition, both from fellow scientists and from religious leaders. Darwin realised that he would need lots of evidence to support his theories. This is one of the reasons why it took him so long to publish his ideas. He spent years trying to put his evidence together in order to convince other scientists.
 He used the amazing animals and plants he had seen on his journeys as part of that evidence. He noted that organisms on different islands had adapted to their environments by natural selection. This meant they had evolved to be different from each other.
 Darwin carried out breeding experiments with pigeons at his home. He wanted to show how features could be artificially selected. Darwin also studied different types of barnacles (small invertebrates found on seashore rocks) and where they lived. This gave him more evidence of organisms adapting and forming different species in different environments. Darwin built up a network of friends, fellow scientists, and pigeon breeders He didn't travel far from home (he was often unwell), but he spent a lot of time discussing his ideas with this group of friends. They helped him gather the evidence needed, and he trusted them as he talked about his ideas. Eventually he was pushed to publish when he realised that someone else— Alfred Wallace — was developing similar ideas. On the 24th of November 1859, Darwin published his revolutionary ideas in his now famous book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (often known as The Origin of Species).The book caused a sensation. Many people were very excited by his ideas and defended them enthusiastically. Others were deeply offended, or simply did not accept them. The Origin of Species sold out on the first day of publication and has never been out of print since! Darwin himself was not impressed by the fuss that was made. He let his children use the back of his original manuscript as drawing paper. Not much of this original manuscript still exists. Most of the pages that remain, Darwin himself kept — but because of his children’s drawings rather than his own writing! There were many different reasons Darwin’s theory of natural selection was only gradually accepted in some places. They include: The theory of evolution by natural selection challenged the belief that God made all of the animals and plants that live on Earth. This religious view was the generally accepted belief among most people in early Victorian England. In spite of all Darwin’s efforts and experiments, many scientists felt there was not enough evidence to convince them of his theory. There was no way to explain how variety and inheritance happened. The mechanism of how inheritance happens— by genes and genetics — was not known until 50 years after Darwin published his ideas. Because there was no mechanism to explain how characteristics could be inherited, Darwin’s theory was much harder for people to accept and understand. The arguments continued and it took some time before the majority of scientists accepted Darwin’s ideas By the time of his death in 1882, Darwin was widely regarded as one of the world’s great scientists, He is buried in Westminster Abbey along with other great scientists such as Sir Isaac Newton.","Explain why the different finch species Darwin found oin the Galapagos Islands looked different ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Evolution and speciation ,"In 1856, 20 years after his return from the voyage on the Beagle. Charles Darwin finally began writing a book about his discoveries. Imagine the effect on him when in 1858 he realised someone else might publish first! Alfred Russel Wallace came from a poor family, with few of Darwin’s opportunities but he almost pipped Darwin to the post. Wallace worked as a builder, a land surveyor, and a teacher before setting off in 1848 on a collecting expedition to South America with Henry Bates, who provided the money.When Wallace returned, his whole collection was destroyed by fire — so he went on another trip with the insurance money! It was on this trip, while Wallace was suffering from a fever on an Indonesian island, that his understanding of evolution dawned. He had the idea that if a species existed in various forms, those which were poorly adapted to change were likely to die out leaving only the better- adapted form to survive and breed. Wallace dashed off a quick paper and sent it to the one man he thought would be really interested and help him get things published — Charles Darwin!
 When Darwin received Wallace’s paper he panicked — after 20 years of careful work, would someone else publish before him? Darwin’s friends advised him to produce an extract summarising his main findings and publish it at the same time as Wallace. Wallace’s ideas were not as carefully crafted as Darwin’s, and they were not backed up by years of research. Astonishingly the two papers, published by the Linneaen Society in 1858, went almost unnoticed, with the Society president complaining that there had been no striking discoveries during the year! The very next year, The Origin of Species was published and Darwin became forever associated with the theory of evolution by natural selection.
 Wallace and Darwin continued to work in mutual support and friendship for many years, their respect for each other far outweighing any rivalry.
 Wallace worked worldwide gathering evidence for his evolutionary theories. He worked on warning colouration in animals, using this as strong supporting evidence of natural selection. He also developed clear theories on the role of geographic isolation in the formation of species. Much of Wallace’s pioneering work acted as the starting point for our current understanding of the process of speciation. Any population will contain natural genetic variation. This means it will contain a wide range of alleles controlling its characteristics that result from sexual reproduction and mutation. This is genetic variation.
 In each population, the alleles that are selected will control characteristics that help the organism to survive and breed successfuIly.This process is natural selection. Sometimes, part of a population becomes isolated because of new environmental conditions. Alleles for characteristics that enable organisms to survive and breed successfully in the new conditions will be selected. These are likely to be different from the alleles that gave success in the original environment. As a result of the selection of these different alleles, the genetic variation between the populations will increase, Eventually, the characteristics change so much that they can no longer interbreed to produce fertile offspring with the original organisms — a new species has formed.This process is known as speciation. The most common way in which populations become separated is by
 geographical isolation.This is when two populations become physically isolated by a geographical feature, for example, a new mountain range, a new river, or an area of land becoming an island. Earthquakes can separate areas of land, and volcanoes can produce completely new islands. The formation of islands often leads to speciation. This is what
 has happened on the island of Borneo, in Australia, and on the Galapagos Islands.The species that have evolved to survive within these isolated environments are very vulnerable to climate change or habitat loss.
 Sometimes organisms are separated by environmental isolation.This is when the climate changes in one area where an organism lives but not in other areas. For example, if the climate becomes warmer in one area, plants will flower at a different time of year.The breeding times of the plants and the animals linked with them will change and eventually new species will emerge.
 Speciation is taking place all the time all over the world. For example, geographical isolation may involve very large areas such as Borneo or very small areas. Mount Bosavi is the crater of an extinct volcano in Papua New Guinea. It is only 4km wide, and the walls of the crater are 1 km high.The animals and plants trapped inside the crater have evolved in different ways to those outside it. During a three-week expedition in 2009, scientists discovered around 40 new species.These included plants, mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. All of these species are the result of natural selection caused by the specialised environment
 of the isolated crater. They include an enormous 82cm long rat that weighs 1.5kg.","Describe how populations become isolated ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Evidence for evolution,"There is no record of the origins of life on Earth. It is a puzzle that can never be completely solved — no one was there to see it! Scientists don’t even know exactly when life on Earth began. However, most think it was somewhere between 3 and 4 billion years ago.
 Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection is now widely accepted as the best explanation of the living world. The understanding of Genetics and how characteristics are passed to offspring in the genes gives a clear mechanism for the process and helps supply the supporting evidence needed. There are several other strong strands of evidence that also support the theory of evolution by natural selection. Some of the best evidence scientists have about the history of life on Earth comes from fossils. Fossils are the remains of organisms from millions of years ago that are found preserved in rocks, ice, and other places. For example, fossils have revealed the world of dinosaurs These giant reptiles dominated the Earth at one stage and died out many millions of years before the evolution of the first human beings. You have probably seen a fossil in a museum or on TV, or maybe even found one yourself Fossils can be formed in a number of ways. When an animal or plant does not decay after it has died. This happens when one or more of the conditions needed for decay are not there. This may be because there is little or no oxygen present.
 It could be because poisonous gases kill off the bacteria that cause decay. Sometimes the temperature is too low for decay to take place. Then the animals and plants are preserved almost intact, for example, in ice or peat. These fossils are rare, but they give a clear insight into what an animal looked like. They can also tell us what an animal had been eating or the colour of a long-extinct flower. Scientists can even extract the DNA and compare it to the DNA of modern organisms. Many fossils are formed when harder parts of the animal or plant are replaced by minerals as they decay and become part of the rock.
 This takes place over long periods. Mould fossils are formed when an impression of an organism is made in mud and then becomes fossilised, while cast fossils are made when a mould is filled in. Rock fossils are the most common form of fossils. One of the biggest herbivores found so far is Argentinosaurus huinculensis. It lived around 70 million years ago, was nearly 40 metres long and probably weighed about 80—100 tonnes! Among the largest carnivores was Giganotosaurus. It was about 14 metres long, with a brain the size of a banana and 20cm-long serrated teeth. For comparison, the biggest living carnivorous lizard, the Komodo dragon, is about 3 metres long and weighs around 140kg. Some of the fossils found are not of actual animals or plants but are preserved traces they have left behind. Fossil footprints, burrows, rootlet traces (evidence of roots), and droppings are all formed. These help us to build up a picture of life on Earth long ago. The fossil record is not complete for several reasons. Many of the very earliest forms of life were soft-bodied organisms. This means they have left little fossil trace. The majority of any fossils that were formed in the earliest days will have been destroyed by geological activity including the formation of mountain ranges, continental movements, erosion, volcanoes, and earthquakes. This is why scientists cannot be absolutely certain about how life on Earth began. Most organisms that died did not become fossilised — the right conditions for fossil formation were rare. Finally, there are many fossils that are still to be found. In spite of all these limitations, the fossils that have been found can still give you a 'snapshot' of life millions of years ago.","Why is it impossible to know for sure how life on earch began ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Fossils and extinction ,"The fossil record helps scientists to understand how much organisms have changed since life developed on Earth. However, this understanding is often limited. Only small pieces of skeletons or little bits of shells have been found.
 Luckily, there is a very complete fossil record for a few animals, including the horse.These relatives complete fossil records can show you how some organisms have changed and developed over time They can also help you to reconstruct the ecology, climate, and environment of millions of years ago.
 Fossils also show you that not all animals have changed very much. For example, fossil sharks from millions of years ago look very like modern sharks. They evolved early into a form that was almost perfectly adapted for their environment and their way of life. Their environment has not changed much for millions of years, so sharks have also remained the same. Throughout the history of Iife on earth, scientists estimate that about 4 billion different species have existed. Yet scientists currently estimate that there are only 8.7 million species of organisms are alive today .The rest have become extinct. Extinction is the permanent loss of all the members of a species. As conditions change, new species evolve that are better suited to survive the new conditions. The older species that cannot cope with the changes gradually die out because they are not able to compete so well for food. This is how evolution takes place by natural selection and the number of species on Earth slowly changes. Some of the species that have become extinct are lost forever or only exist in the fossil record, while other species have descendants living on Earth today. There are many different causes of extinction, but they always involve a change in the environment of the organism. This could be a change in temperature. new predators, new diseases, or new, more successful competitors. It could also be changes to the environment over geological time or single catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions or collisions with asteroids. Living organisms can change an environment and cause extinction in several different ways: New predators can wipe out unsuspecting prey animals very quickly if the prey animals do not have adaptations to avoid them, New predators may evolve, or an existing species might simply move into new territory. Sometimes this can be due to human intervention. Hedgehogs were introduced to the Scottish island of North Uist in 1974 to combat the problem of garden slugs. Unfortunately, the hedgehogs bred rapidly and now eat the eggs and chicks of the many rare sea birds that breed on the island. Now people are trying to kill or remove the hedgehogs from the island to save the birds. New diseases can bring a species to the point of extinction. They are most likely to cause extinctions on islands, where the whole population of an animal or plant is close together. The Australian Tasmanian devil is one example of this. These rare animals are dying from a new form of communicable cancer that attacks and kills them very quickly. Finally, one species can cause another to become extinct by successful competition. New mutations can give one type of organism a real advantage over another, Sometimes new species are Introduced into an environment by mistake. This means that a new, more successful competitor can take over from the original animal or plant and cause it to become extinct. For example, in Australia, the introduction of rabbits has caused severe problems. They eat so much and breed so fast that the other native Australian animals are dying out because they cannot compete with the rabbits for food.","Explain how new predators can cause extinction ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Antibiotic resistant bacteria ,"If you are given an antibiotic and use it properly, the bacteria that have made you ill are killed off. However, some bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. They have a natural mutation (change in their genetic material) that means they are not affected by the antibiotic. These mutations happen by chance and they produce new strains of bacteria by natural selection. Bacteria can evolve rapidly because they reproduce at a fast rate. Normally, an antibiotic kills the bacteria of a non-resistant strain. However, individual resistant bacteria survive and reproduce, so the population of resistant bacteria increases. Antibiotics are no longer active against this new resistant strain of the pathogen. As a result, the new strain will spread rapidly because no one is immune to it and there is no effective treatment. This is what has happened with bacteria such as MRSA . More types of bacteria are becoming resistant to more antibiotics, so bacterial diseases are becoming more difficult to treat. To prevent more resistant strains of bacteria appearing: It is important not to overuse antibiotics. For this reason, doctors no longer use antibiotics to treat non-serious infections such as mild throat or ear infections. Also, since antibiotics don’t affect viruses, people should not request antibiotics to treat an illness that their doctor believes is caused by a virus. It is also important that patients finish their course of medicine every time. This is to make sure that all bacteria are killed by the antibiotic, so none survive to mutate and form resistant strains. It is important to restrict the agricultural use of antibiotics. This is to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance from animal to human pathogens. In the UK we already have many restrictions in place. Other countries are not so careful. In the USA,70% of human antibiotics are also used on farm animals, often to speed up growth or prevent rather than cure infections. Hopefully, these measures will slow the development of resistant strains. Hospitals use a lot of antibiotics to treat infections. As a result of natural selection, some of the bacteria in hospitals are resistant to many antibiotics.This is what has happened with MRSA, the bacterium methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. As doctors and nurses move from patient to patient, these antibiotic resistant bacteria are Spread easily. At its peak in the early 21st century, MRSA alone caused or contributed to over 1000 deaths every year in UK hospitals and care homes. A number of simple measures to reduce the spread of microorganisms such as MRSA have been widely implemented in England and Wales. Antibiotics should only be used when they are really needed. Specific bacteria should be treated with specific antibiotics. Medical staff should wash their hands with soap and water or use alcohol gel between patient visits and wear disposable clothing or clothing that is regularly sterilised. Hospitals should have high standards of hygiene so that they are really clean. Patients who become infected with antibiotic resistant bacteria should be looked after in isolation from other patients. Visitors to hospitals and care homes should wash their hands as they enter and leave. Simple common sense measures such as these can have a considerable effect on reducing deaths from antibiotic resistant bacteria. In recent years, doctors have found strains of bacteria that are resistant to even the strongest antibiotics When that happens, there is nothing more that antibiotics can do for a patient and he or she may well die, Scientists are constantly looking for new antibiotics. However, it isn’t easy to find chemicals that kill bacteria without damaging human cells.
 Penicillin and several other antibiotics are made from microorganisms. Scientists are exploring sources from crocodile blood and fish slime, to soil samples and the ocean depths to produce a new antibiotic to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria. The development of new antibiotics is both expensive and slow. It seems unlikely that the appearance of new antibiotics will keep up with the development of new antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.","Is MRSA a bacterium or a virus ?

Genetics and reproduction,Genetics and evolution,Classification,"Classification is the organisation of living things into groups according to their similarities. Biologists classify organisms to make it easier to study them. Classification allows us to make sense of the living world.
 It also helps us to understand how the different groups of living things are related to each other. Perhaps most importantly, it enables us to recognise the biodiversity present in the world and gives scientists a common language in winch to talk about it. Living things are classified by studying their similarities and differences. Classification as it’s known today really began in the 18th century with Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist (plant biologist). He grouped organisms together depending on their structure and characteristics. Linnaeus made many careful observations of living things and used a hierarchical structure to classify them. The way we classify organisms today is Still based on the Linnaean system, which is also known as the natural classification system, Linnaeus classified organisms into the following groups — kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. When Linnaeus first devised his classification system, the number of known types of living things was much smaller than it is today and so he suggested just two kingdoms, the animals and the plants. Kingdoms contain lots of organisms with many differences Due a few important similarities. For example, all animals move their whole bodies about during at least part of their life cycle, and their cells do not have cellulose cell walls. On the other hand, plants do not move their whole bodies about and their cells have cellulose cell walls. Also, some plant cells contain chloroplasts full of chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Now scientists know of many more organisms and they also know much more about them. Developments in microscopes have enabled scientists to compare the internal structures of cells. They also know a great deal more about the biochemistry of different organisms. You can even compare the genomes of organisms. As a result, classification systems have changed. At one stage scientists used five kingdoms to classify organisms — the prokaryotes, Protista, fungi, plants, and animals. However, later research has shown even that model to be too simple. Now most scientists accept a three domain, six kingdom model. To give the six kingdoms, the prokaryotes were divided into the archaebacteria, ancient bacteria-like organisms, and the eubacteria (the normal bacteria that we might grow in the school laboratory). The smallest group of clearly identified living organisms in Linnaeus's classification system is a species. Members of the same species are very similar. A species is a group of organisms that can breed together and produce fertile offspring. Orang-utans, dandelions, and brown trout are all examples of separate species of living organisms. The huge variety of living organisms and the number of different languages spoken means that the same organism can have many different names around the world.This makes it impossible for one biologist to know what organism another is talking about!
 The problem is Solved because every organism has a scientific name given using a binomial system again first put forward by Carl Linnaeus. Binomial means two names The two names of an organism are in Latin and they give the genus and the species of the organism. Even in the time of Linnaeus, Latin was no longer spoken but was the language of scholars everywhere.This meant no-one was offended because their language was not chosen — yet most people could understand the names.","Define classification ?
